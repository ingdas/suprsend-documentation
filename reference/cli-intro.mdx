<Note>
**Beta Feature** - The SuprSend CLI is under active development. Commands and flags may change, and new functionality will be added over time. If you encounter issues or need additional commands, please open an issue on GitHub or contribute directly — the project is open source.
</Note>

The **SuprSend CLI** is a powerful command-line interface that enables developers to setup CI/CD pipeline for notification changes and manage, automate, and sync SuprSend assets across multiple workspaces. With a few commands, you can handle workflows, schemas, events, and even integrate directly with AI agents.

## Benefits of using SuprSend CLI

Developers often prefer CLI as it offers **speed, automation, and flexibility**. Instead of writing boilerplate code or clicking through multiple screens on UI, you can run a single command or script to perform repeatable actions—ideal for modern DevOps and automation.

By using the CLI, you can:

- **Automate with CI/CD Deployment** – Release notification changes through feature or bugfix branches, just like any other piece of code: version it, test it, and deploy it.
- **Work with assets locally** – Create, edit, and commit workflows, schemas, and translation files locally.
- **Version Control Changes** – Pull all assets locally and track them in Git for maintaining release history.
- **Enforce Approval gates for production releases** - Setup strict checks that all changes on production go through approval process so that nothing goes live without check.

## What You Can Do with SuprSend CLI

- **Manage Assets** – List, pull, push, and commit notification workflows, schemas, preference categories, and events.  
- **Sync Across Workspaces** – Transfer assets between workspaces for multi-environment setups.  
- **AI Agent Integration** – Start an MCP server from the CLI and connect SuprSend with AI agents or developer copilots.

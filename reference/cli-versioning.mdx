<Note>
**Beta Release:** The SuprSend CLI is currently in beta. While core functionality is stable, some features may evolve as we continue to improve the developer experience. We recommend validating your workflows in a staging environment before rolling out to production.

## Versioning Policy

SuprSend's CLI versioning policy follows **[Semantic Versioning (SemVer)](https://semver.org/)**. For example, in version 0.2.15, 0 is the **major**, 2 is the **minor**, and 15 is the **patch**.

**Major.** Breaking changes that are backward incompatible (e.g., renaming commands, changing command structure, modifying profile format).

**Minor.** New features that are backward compatible (e.g., adding new commands, optional flags, new subcommands).

**Patch.** Backward-compatible bug fixes (e.g., fixing command execution errors, improving error messages, performance optimizations).

Each CLI version is coupled with the API version that was current at the time of release, ensuring stable and predictable behavior across versions.

## Support Policy

All new features, performance improvements, and bug fixes are released on the latest major version. Older major versions remain functional but don't receive updates.

SuprSend maintains backward compatibility across CLI versions, ensuring existing commands, workflow operations, profile configurations, and CI/CD scripts continue to work. We recommend upgrading to the latest version to access new commands, improved authentication, better performance, and new integrations like translations and type generation.

CLI and API versions are synchronized, ensuring CLI commands always work with the current API and new platform features are immediately available via CLI. When upgrading between major versions, detailed changelogs and migration notes are provided.

## Platform Support

The CLI is available for macOS (arm64, x64), Linux (arm64, x86_64), and Windows (arm64, x86_64). All platforms receive full support with regular updates and security patches.

For installation instructions, see the [Installation Guide](/reference/cli-installation).

## Release Policy

New CLI features are released as and when we add / update management APIs. New versions include new commands, feature enhancements, bug fixes, and security updates. User-facing commands maintain backward compatibility within the same major version.

Critical bug fixes (command execution failures, authentication problems, sync errors) are released immediately, while minor improvements are batched for regular releases. Releases are announced on our [Slack community](https://suprsend.com/slack) and via [email newsletters](https://suprsend.com/newsletter). See the [CLI Changelog](/reference/cli-changelog) for detailed release notes.

## Open Source & Contributions

The SuprSend CLI is an **open source project** hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/suprsend/cli). We welcome community contributions to improve the CLI, whether it's adding new features, fixing bugs, improving documentation, or enhancing the developer experience.

**How to contribute:**
- Visit the [SuprSend CLI GitHub repository](https://github.com/suprsend/cli) to explore the codebase
- Fork the repository and create a feature branch for your changes
- Open a Pull Request with a clear description of your changes
- Our team will review and merge contributions that align with the project goals

## Best Practices

- **Check the CLI version after upgrading**:  
Run `suprsend --version` to confirm the expected version is installed.

- **Review the changelog for new capabilities**:<br/>
Skim the [changelog](/reference/cli-changelog) to understand newly added features or behavior changes.

- **Keep CI/CD environments in sync**:<br/>
Pin the CLI version in CI/CD pipelines to avoid unexpected differences across environments.

- **Upgrade incrementally**<br/>
Prefer patch and minor upgrades before moving to major versions.

- **Re-authenticate only if prompted**<br/>
Existing authentication and profiles are preserved across upgrades in most cases.

<Note>
💡 **Pro tip:** Treat CLI like any other core developer dependency—keep versions consistent across local and CI environments for predictable behavior.

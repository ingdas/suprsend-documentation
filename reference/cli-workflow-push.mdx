<Warning>
🚨 **Push and Commit Behavior**:
- **New workflow not showing up?** → Push without commit first, then commit separately
- **Changes not appearing in live mode?** → Check if workflows are linked to other workflows
- **Fix**: Update your workflow files to include all dependencies, or remove the links
</Warning>

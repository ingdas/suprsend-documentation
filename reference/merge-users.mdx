In SuprSend, you can merge duplicate user identities into a single `distinct_id` to consolidate user profiles, especially when users interact across different products or transition from anonymous to identified states. You can use it in following scenarios:

- If a user can log into multiple products (such as different apps or services within your platform) and has different identifiers across products which needs to be merged later.
- **Anonymous to Identified Transition**: Many platforms allow users to interact or explore the product anonymously before signing up. During this period, user actions are typically tracked under an anonymous ID. Once the user signs up or logs in, you can merge the anonymous profile into their newly created identifier. This preserves any data collected during the anonymous period and associates it with the user’s identified profile. You need to [create a user](https://docs.suprsend.com/reference/create-update-users) with the new identifier first before merging the profiles.

### How profile merge works?

When you merge two users, there's a primary user passed in your API path param and merge a secondary / old user passed as `from_user_id` in your payload. The primary distinct_id is retained after the merge and the `from_user_id` is deleted. The deletion process is permanent and `from_user_id` can't be recovered once deleted.

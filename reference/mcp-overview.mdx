## Overview

The SuprSend MCP server exposes key SuprSend components — such as workflows, users, tenants, objects, and preferences — through the Model Context Protocol. With MCP, your AI agents can directly query, update, and manage SuprSend resources, as well as trigger notifications, all through tool calling.

## What can you do with MCP?

Instead of manually navigating through the SuprSend dashboard or writing complex API calls, you can simply tell your AI assistant what you want to accomplish. Here are some examples of how you can use the MCP server:

- **Search documentation and apply results.** 
"Find the setup guide for integrating the React Drop-in Inbox and insert the required code snippet into my project."

- **Trigger workflows on demand.**
"Run the approval-required workflow for user John Doe to test my notification setup."

- **Bootstrap test data.**
"Create a sample user named John Doe and a tenant called acme-corp in my workspace."

- **Manage notification preferences.**
"Enable email notifications for marketing team and disable SMS."

- **Configure tenant-level branding.**
"Update the logo and primary color for the enterprise tenant to match the new design guidelines."

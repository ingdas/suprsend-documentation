SuprSend supports making requests idempotent to ensure that requests can be retried safely without duplicate processing. If SuprSend receives and processes a request with an `idempotency_key`, it will skip processing requests with same `idempotency_key` for next 24 hours. You can use this key to track webhooks related to workflow notifications.

To make an idempotent request, pass `idempotency_key` in the workflow instance. Idempotency-key should be unique that you generate for each request. You may use any string up to 255 characters in length as an idempotency-key. Ensure that you don’t add any space in start and end of the key as it will be trimmed.

Here are some common approaches for assigning idempotency-keys:

- **Generate a random UUID** for each request.
- **Construct the idempotency-key by combining relevant information about the request**. This can include parameters, identifiers, or specific contextual details that are meaningful within your application. e.g., you could concatenate the user ID, action, and timestamp to form an idempotency-key like `user147-new-comment-1687437670`
- **Request-specific Identifier**: If your request already contains a unique identifier, such as an order ID or a job ID, you can use that identifier directly as the idempotency-key.

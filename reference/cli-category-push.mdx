Categories are pushed in draft state until committed.\

You can either pass the --commit=true flag to push and commit categories in a single step, or commit them later using the [`category commit`](/reference/cli-category-commit) command to make them live. \

Until committed, changes remain inactive and will not be reflected in your application or workflow settings.

## Syntax

```bash
suprsend category push [flags]
```

### Frequently Asked Questions

<Accordion title="I have pushed my categories but don’t see the updated categories in live mode.">
You can view detailed logs by enabling debug mode `export DEBUG=true` in your terminal. 
In most cases, this happens when an existing preference category is being overridden by the latest push and that category is already linked to a workflow. When this occurs, the changes cannot be committed to **live mode**.

The updated categories will still appear in **draft** mode, but you’ll need to update or unlink the workflows before committing the changes live.

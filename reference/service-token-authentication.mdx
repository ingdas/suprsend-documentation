Management APIs in SuprSend use Service Token authentication instead of the usual API Key authentication used in other APIs. 
Service tokens are created at account level and are used to manage resources and assets (like workflows, templates, schemas, etc.) across workspaces.

## Generating Service Tokens

Service tokens can be generated from your SuprSend dashboard:

1. Go to [SuprSend dashboard → Account Settings → Service Tokens](https://app.suprsend.com/en/account-settings/service-tokens)
2. `Generate a new Token` and provide a descriptive name which tells the purpose of the token.
3. Click on `Create and View`. Copy and store the token somewhere safe. For security purposes, token will only be shown at the time of generation.


## Authorizing Management APIs

To authorize your API request, pass service token in the `Authorization` header as `ServiceToken XXXX`, where XXXX is the service token.

**Example Header:**

``` curl
Authorization: ServiceToken <service_token>
```

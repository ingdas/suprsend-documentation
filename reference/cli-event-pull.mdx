Pull events from a SuprSend workspace into your local directory. This action does not delete existing events; instead, it overwrites events with the same name or creates new ones. <br/><br/>
By default, pulled events are stored in the `suprsend/event/` directory, but you can change the destination using the -d flag. We recommend specifying a directory when working with multiple production or staging workspaces.

## Syntax

```bash
suprsend event pull [flags]
```

## Flags

| Flag | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `-h, --help` | Show help for the command | – |
| `-d, --dir string` | Directory to pull events to | `suprsend/event` |
| `-w, --workspace string` | Workspace to pull events from | `staging` |

## Example

```bash
# Pull all events to default directory
suprsend event pull

# Pull events into custom directory path
suprsend event pull --dir dev-environment/events

# Pull events from production workspace
suprsend event pull --workspace production
```

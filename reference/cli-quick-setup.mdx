## Quick Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the CLI">
    Install the SuprSend CLI using your preferred package manager:

    <CodeGroup>

    ```bash npm
    npm install -g @suprsend/cli
    ```

    
    ```bash yarn
    yarn global add @suprsend/cli
    ```

    
    ```bash pnpm
    pnpm add -g @suprsend/cli
    ```

    
    ```bash curl
    curl -fsSL https://cli.suprsend.com/install.sh | sh
    ```

    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authenticate">
    Authenticate with your SuprSend workspace:

    ```bash
    suprsend auth login
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable Autocompletion">
    Enable command autocompletion for a smoother development experience:

    <CodeGroup>

    ```bash bash
    # For bash
    suprsend completion bash >> ~/.bashrc
    source ~/.bashrc
    ```

    
    ```bash zsh
    # For zsh
    suprsend completion zsh >> ~/.zshrc
    source ~/.zshrc
    ```

    
    ```bash fish
    # For fish
    suprsend completion fish >> ~/.config/fish/completions/suprsend.fish
    ```

    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Sync Your Project">
    Pull your existing workflows and sync your project:

    ```bash
    # Pull all workflows from your workspace
    suprsend workflow pull
    
    # Initialize sync for your project
    suprsend sync
    ```

    <Note>
      This will create a `suprsend` directory with your workflows, schemas, and configurations.
    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Try a Complete Workflow

    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy to Production">
    Push your changes to production:

Pull workflows from a SuprSend workspace into your local directory or server. This action does not delete existing workflows; instead, it overwrites workflows with the same slug or creates new ones. <br/><br/>
By default, pulled workflows are stored in the `suprsend/workflow/` directory, but you can change the destination using the -d flag. We recommend specifying a directory when working with multiple production or staging workspaces.

## Syntax

```bash
suprsend workflow pull [flags]
```

## Flags

| Flag | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `-h, --help` | Show help for the command | – |
| `-g, --slug string` | Pull individual workflow by passing it's slug | – |
| `-d, --dir string` | Custom directory path for saving pulled workflows | `suprsend/workflow` |
| `-m, --mode string` | Workflow mode to pull (`live` or `draft`) | `live` |


## Example

```bash
# Pull all live workflows to current directory
suprsend workflow pull

# Pull workflows into custom directory path
suprsend workflow pull --dir dev-environment/workflows

# Pull draft workflows from production
suprsend workflow pull --mode draft --workspace production

# Pull individual workflow by passing it's slug
suprsend workflow pull --slug welcome-email
```

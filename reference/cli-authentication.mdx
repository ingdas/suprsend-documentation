## Get Your Service Token

1. Log in to your [SuprSend dashboard](https://app.suprsend.com)
2. Go to **Account Settings → Service Tokens**
3. Create a new service token or copy an existing one

## Authentication Methods

The CLI resolves authentication using this priority order:

| Priority | Method              | When to Use                                          | Duration       |
|----------|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| 1        | Environment Variable | Running the CLI inside **CI/CD pipelines, Docker containers and servers** | Session-based  |
| 2        | Command-Line Flag    | Best for **one-off commands, local testing, debugging** | One-time       |
| 3        | Active Profile       | For local development or self hosting where you have more than 1 server | Persistent     |


### Environment Variable

**Best for development environments, CI/CD jobs, or scripts.**  
Define your token once per session, and all CLI commands in that script will use it automatically.


```bash
export SUPRSEND_SERVICE_TOKEN="your_service_token_here"
```

### Command-Line Flag

**Best for running ad-hoc commands locally or for testing or debugging with different credentials.** <br/>
Pass the token inline without modifying your environment. We don't recommend this method since flags can appear in shell history or process listings.

```bash
suprsend workflow list --service-token "your_service_token_here"
```

### Active Profile
**Best for local development or self-hosted setups where you have more than one server.**<br/>
Profile lets you save your configuration once, so you don’t need to re-export tokens in every session. You can create multiple profiles and simply switch the active profile when needed.

```bash
suprsend profile add --name eu-server --service-token "your_token_here"
suprsend profile use eu-server
```

## Security best practices

- **Do not commit tokens** in scripts, repositories, or configuration files. 
- Prefer **environment variables or profiles** over command-line flags, since flags can appear in shell history or process listings. 
- **Rotate service tokens regularly** and follow principle of least privilege and restrict permissions to the minimum required.

### Rotation Strategy

**1. Scheduled Rotation:** Implement a scheduled rotation of service tokens (e.g. every 6 months) to reduce the risk of long-term exposure.

**2. Ad-Hoc Rotation:** Rotate tokens immediately if you suspect that a token has been compromised or if it has been inadvertently exposed.

title: Create or Update Preference Category
openapi: "POST /v1/{workspace}/preference_category/"
sidebarTitle: Create/Update Category

⚠️ This API call will **override existing categories** with whatever is passed in the request body. Recommended approach is to first fetch the current categories using [GET method](/reference/get-category), modify the response as needed, and then send it back in the request body. <br/>
You can read more about preference categories [here](/docs/notification-category).

<Note>
  <p>
    <strong>Note:</strong>
    Changes will only be pushed if `"validation_result":{"is_valid":true}` in the response. General reasons for validation failure are: 
        - There are multiple categories with the same slug
        - Some subcategories have been deleted in this version, on which active workflows are configured
        - You've not passed all three categories in the request body - system, transactional, promotional

## Installation

### Homebrew (Recommended)

**Best for developers on macOS or Linux** who want the easiest installation and upgrade path with package manager support.

```bash
brew tap suprsend/tap
brew install suprsend
```

### Binary Releases

**Best for Windows users, servers or CI/CD environments** where you need a pre-compiled binary without relying on package managers.

Download from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/suprsend/cli/releases).

```bash
# Linux/macOS
chmod +x suprsend
sudo mv suprsend /usr/local/bin/

# Windows: Extract suprsend.exe to your PATH
```

### Source Build

**Best for contributors or advanced users** who want the latest unreleased features by building from source. Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows with Go installed.

To build SuprSend CLI from source, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Go installed on your system (version 1.20 or later).

2. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/suprsend/cli.git
cd cli/cmd/suprsend
```

3. Build the binary:
```bash
go build -o suprsend
```

4. The binary will be created in the current directory. You can move it to a location in your PATH for easy access:
```bash
sudo mv suprsend /usr/local/bin/
```

## Verify Installation
After installation, you can use CLI by running `suprsend` command. For example:

```bash
suprsend --help
suprsend version
```

<Note>
When you run `suprsend version`, you should see the latest version (currently **v1.0.0**). If you see an older version, you may need to update your installation.

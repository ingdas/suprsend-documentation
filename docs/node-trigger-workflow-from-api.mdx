description: "Guide to configure and trigger workflow from API"
---

It is a unified API to trigger workflow and doesn't require user creation before hand to trigger notification. Recommended for platforms transitioning their existing notifications to SuprSend. If you are using our frontend SDKs to configure notifications and passing events and user properties from third-party data platforms like Segment, then [event-based trigger](/docs/node-send-event-data) would be a better choice.

<Info>
  📘 Available in SDK version >= 1.10.0
</Info>

## Payload Schema

Once your request is accepted, you can check the status of your request in the [SuprSend Logs](https://app.suprsend.com/en/staging/log).

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Sample Payload 
const {Suprsend, WorkflowTriggerRequest} = require("@suprsend/node-sdk");

const supr_client = new Suprsend("_workspace_key_", "_workspace_secret_");

const workflow_payload = {
    "workflow": "_workflow_slug_",
    "actor": {
      "distinct_id": "0fxxx8f74-xxxx-41c5-8752-xxxcb6911fb08",
      "name":"actor_1"
    },
    "recipients": [
      {
        "distinct_id": "0gxxx9f14-xxxx-23c5-1902-xxxcb6912ab09",
        "$email":["abc@example.com"],
        "name":"recipient_1",
        "$preferred_language": "en",
				"$timezone": "America/New_York"
      }
    ],
    "data":{
      "first_name": "User",
      "invoice_amount": "$5000",
      "invoice_id":"Invoice-1234"
    }
}

// create workflow instance
const wf = new WorkflowTriggerRequest(workflow_payload, {tenant_id: "tenant_id1", idempotency_key: "_unique_request_identifier"})

const response = supr_client.workflows.trigger(wf); // trigger workflow 
response.then(res => console.log("response", res));
```


```javascript Response
{
  success: true,
  status: 'success',
  status_code: 202,
  message: '{"status":"success"}'
}
```

## Sending notification to multiple users

Recipients in workflow call is an array of `distinct_ids` or recipient objects. You can pass upto 100 recipients in a single workflow trigger. SuprSend will internally convert it into multiple workflow triggers, one for each recipient in the array.

<CodeGroup>

```json json
"recipients": ["distinct_id1","distinct_id2"]

---- OR ------

"recipients": [
  {
    "distinct_id": "id1",
    "$email":["id1@example.com"],
    "name":"recipient_1"
  },
  {
    "distinct_id": "id1",
    "$email":["id2@example.com"],
    "name":"recipient_2"
  }
]
```

</CodeGroup>

<Note>
  **Use lists to broadcast to a large list of users:**

  We recommend you to use [lists](/docs/node-lists) and [broadcast](/docs/node-broadcast) to send notifications to a user list larger than 1000 users. This approach allows bulk processing, resulting in significantly faster delivery compared to individual workflow calls. Sending individual workflows to a large set of users may introduce delays in your notification queue.
</Note>

## Identifying recipients inline

One of the benefits of using direct workflow trigger is that you can identify recipients inline. You can include recipient channel information, their channel preferences, and their user properties along with the workflow trigger. Upon triggering the workflow, the recipient will be automatically created in the SuprSend database in the background. This facilitates dynamic synchronization of your user data within SuprSend and eliminates the need for any migration efforts on your end to start sending notifications from SuprSend. You can also use recipient properties in your template as `$recipient.<property>`.

This is how the complete recipient object with look like

<CodeGroup>

```json json
"recipients": [{
  "distinct_id": "0gxxx9f14-xxxx-23c5-1902-xxxcb6912ab09",
  "$email":["abc@example.com"], // email communication channel
  "$sms":["+15555555555"], // sms communication channel
  "$channels":["email","inbox"],
  "$preferred_language":"en",
  "$timezone": "America/New_York",
  "custom_prop1":"value_1", // custom property
  "custom_prop2": "value_2", // custom property
}]
```

### Sending cross-user notifications

In scenarios where you need to notify a group of users based on another user's action, such as sending a notification to the document owner when someone comments on it, you can specify the actor in your workflow call. This allows you to use actor's name or other properties in your notification template. Actor properties can be included in the template as `$actor.<property>`.

<CodeGroup>

```json text
//handlebar template
Hi {{$recipient.name}}, {{$actor.name}} added {{length comments}} new comments on the {{doc_name}}.

// rendered content with Sample Data
Hi recipient_1, actor_1 added 2 new comments on the annual IT report.
```

</CodeGroup>

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Sample Workflow Body
{
  "workflow": "new_comment",
  "actor": {
    "distinct_id": "0fxxx8f74-xxxx-41c5-8752-xxxcb6911fb08",
    "name":"actor_1"
  },
  "recipients": [
    {
      "distinct_id": "0gxxx9f14-xxxx-23c5-1902-xxxcb6912ab09",
      "$email":["abc@example.com"],
      "name":"recipient_1"
    }
  ],
  "data":{
    "doc_name": "annual IT report",
    "date": "2024-01-01",
    "comments":["change the date","rest looks good"]
  }
}
```

</CodeGroup>

### Sending notification to anonymous user

You can send notifications to anonymous users by passing ` "is_transient": true` in your recipient object. This approach is recommended for scenarios where you need to send notifications to unregistered users without creating them in the SuprSend platform. The same way, you can pass ` "is_transient": true` in your actor object to use actor properties in template without creating user profile.

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Request
const workflow_payload = {
    "workflow": "_workflow_slug_",
    "actor": {
      "is_transient": true, // for anonymous actor
      "name":"actor_1"
    },
    "recipients": [
      {
        "is_transient": true, // for anonymous recipient
        "$email":["abc@example.com"],
        "name":"recipient_1"
      }
    ],
    "data":{
      "first_name": "User",
      "invoice_amount": "$5000",
      "invoice_id":"Invoice-1234"
    }
}
```

</CodeGroup>

## Multi-tenant notifications

For cases where you want to send notifications to your enterprise customers end users, pass the `tenant_id` in your workflow instance. You can use this to dynamically manage [tenant level notification customizations](/docs/brands). This includes the ability to customize template design or content and route notifications via tenant vendors.

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Request
const workflow = new WorkflowTriggerRequest(workflow_body, {tenant_id: "tenant_id1"})
```

</CodeGroup>

## Idempotent requests

SuprSend supports idempotency to ensure that requests can be retried safely without duplicate processing. If Suprsend receives and processes a request with an idempotency_key, it will skip processing requests with same `idempotency_key` for next 24 hours. Idempotency key should be uniquely generated for each request (max 255 characters allowed). Spaces in start and end of the key will be trimmed. Here are some common approaches for generating idempotency keys:

- **Generate a random UUID** for each request.
- **Construct the idempotency key by combining relevant information about the request**. This can include parameters, identifiers, or specific contextual details that are meaningful within your application. For example, you could concatenate the user ID, action, and timestamp to form an idempotency key like `user147-new-comment-1687437670`
- **Request-specific Identifier**: If your request already contains a unique identifier, such as an order ID or a job ID, you can use that identifier directly as the idempotency key.

<CodeGroup>

```javascript javascript
const workflow = new WorkflowTriggerRequest(workflow_body, {idempotency_key: "_unique_request_identifier"})
```

</CodeGroup>

## Bulk API for triggering multiple workflows

Bulk API allows you to send multiple workflow requests in a single call. Use `.append()` and `workflows.bulk_trigger_instance()` to add however-many-records to call in bulk.

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Request
const {Suprsend, WorkflowTriggerRequest} = require("@suprsend/node-sdk");

const supr_client = new Suprsend("_workspace_key_", "_workspace_secret_");

const wf1 = new WorkflowTriggerRequest(wf_body1, {tenant_id: "tenant_id1", idempotency_key: "_unique_identifier_of_the_request_"}) // workflow1 instance
const wf2 = new WorkflowTriggerRequest(body2)  // workflow2 instance

const bulk_ins = supr_client.workflows.bulk_trigger_instance() // create bulk instance

bulk_ins.append(wf1,wf2)  // add workflows instances to bulk instance

const response = bulk_ins.trigger(); // trigger workflows 
response.then(res => console.log("response", res));
```


```javascript Response
{
  status: "success/fail/partial",
  total: 10,
  success: 10,
  failure: 0,
  failed_records: [{"record": {...}, "error": "error_str", "code": "<status_code>"}],
  warnings: []
}
```

</CodeGroup>

## Add attachment (in email)

To add one or more attachments to a notification (viz. Email), call `wf_instance.add_attachment()` for each file with local path or remote attachment url. Ensure that file path is valid, and public(for remote url) otherwise it will raise error.

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Request
const wf_instance = new WorkflowTriggerRequest(wf_body);

wf_instance.add_attachment("/home/user/billing.pdf");
wf_instance.add_attachment("https://www.adobe.com/sample_file.pdf");
```

</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
  A single workflow instance size (including attachment) must not exceed 100KB (100 x 1024 bytes).
</Warning>

You can trigger workflow from node SDK by using `supr_client.trigger_workflow` method. Import _Workflow class_ before calling this method. \
Once your request is accepted, you can check the status of your request in the '[ SuprSend Logs](https://app.suprsend.com/en/staging/logs)' section.

#### Bulk API for triggering multiple workflows.

Bulk API allows you to send multiple workflow requests in a single call. There isn't any limit on number-of-records that can be added to bulk_workflows instance. Use `.append()` on `bulk_workflows` instance to add however-many-records to call in bulk.

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Request
const { Workflow } = require("@suprsend/node-sdk")

const bulk_ins = supr_client.bulk_workflows.new_instance()

// one or more workflow instances
const workflow1 = new Workflow({...}) // body must be a proper workflow request json/dict
const workflow2 = new Workflow({...}) // body must be a proper workflow request json/dict

// --- use .append on bulk instance to add one or more records
bulk_ins.append(workflow1)
bulk_ins.append(workflow2)
// OR
bulk_ins.append(workflow1, workflow2)

// -------
const response = bulk_ins.trigger()
response.then((res) => console.log("response", res));
```


```javascript Response
// Response structure
{
  status: "success",
  total: 10, // number of records sent in bulk
  success: 10, // number of records succeeded
  failure: 0, // number of records failed
  failed_records: [],
  warnings: []
}

{
  status: "fail",
  total: 10, // number of records sent in bulk
  success: 0, // number of records succeeded
  failure: 10, // number of records failed
  failed_records: [{"record": {...}, "error": "error_str", "code": 500}],
  warnings: []
}

{
  status: "partial",
  total: 10, // number of records sent in bulk
  success: 6, // number of records succeeded
  failure: 4, // number of records failed
  failed_records: [{"record": {...}, "error": "error_str", "code": 500}],
  warnings: []
}
```

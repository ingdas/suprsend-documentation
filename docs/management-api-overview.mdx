<Note>
**Note:** The SuprSend management API only provides access to the resources managed in **the SuprSend dashboard**, such as workflows, templates, schemas, translations.

APIs to manage all other data such as users, trigger workflows, manage tenants, preferences, etc. are available in the [API Reference](/reference/overview).
</Note>

Management APIs can be used to manage and push, pull SuprSend assets across workspaces.

## Authentication

The management API authenticates with a ServiceToken authentication. You can get service token by going to your account settings -> Service Tokens tab.


```curl
Authorization: ServiceToken YOUR_SERVICE_TOKEN
```

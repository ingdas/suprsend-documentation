SuprSend sends Whatsapp to your users via reputed Whatsapp service providers (called Vendors on SuprSend platform). You need to make an account with atleast **one** of these providers, and provide login credentials of these accounts on SuprSend dashboard. Once this is done, you will be able to send Whatsapp to your users via SuprSend.

All integrations related to sending Whatsapp, collecting responses, and maintenance will be handled by SuprSend. Whenever you would like to add more Whatsapp providers, or switch providers, simply add a new Whatsapp provider on SuprSend dashboard and make it 'Default'; your messages will start going from that provider.

SuprSend has done integration with following Whatsapp vendors. These vendors are chosen carefully on the basis of multiple factors, like IP reputation, shared vs dedicated IP, delivery rate, strength of APIs, real-time monitoring, etc. We will be adding more Whatsapp providers shortly.

## Add Whatsapp Vendors based on Workspaces

You may have different whatsapp vendor accounts for staging and for production. Hence, we have given an option to add Whatsapp vendors based on your workspaces. Make sure that you add vendor details for each workspace, else communications will fail to deliver. Read more about Workspaces [here](/docs/workspace).

description: "This is a quick setup guide to start sending Inbox notifications with SuprSend."
---

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create SuprSend account">
    Simply [signup](https://auth.suprsend.com/sign-up) on SuprSend to create your account. If you already have your company account setup, ask your admin to invite you to the team.
  </Step>

  <Step title="See a live demo of Inbox Implementation in playground">
    You'll also get the sample code for all types of Inbox views in the [GitHub repo](https://inbox-playground.suprsend.com/) linked in the playground.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start testing in Sandbox workspace">
    <Note>
      📘 You can test the entire notification flow (follow steps 4-6) without integrating Inbox in Sandbox workspace. All the notifications sent to your registered email ID in Sandbox will show up in the top bell icon.&#x20;



      OR



      You can directly integrate Inbox in your product ([follow step 7](/docs/inbox-quick-start#7-integrate-inbox-in-your-product)) and test the notification directly inside your product. For that, you'll have to test the flow in staging workspace.
    </Note>

    **Different workspaces and their usage:**

    You'll see 3 workspaces in your SuprSend account: Sandbox, Staging and Production. Workspaces can be switched from top navigation bar.

    * **Sandbox** is setup for quick testing with sample workflow, a sample user with your registered email and pre-configured channels for quick testing. It's ideal for quick exploration and testing and is available for limited period.

    * **Staging** is your development workspace. You'll do all your iterations and testing in this workspace before pushing it to production.

    * **Production** workspace is where you'll configure your live notifications and sync your actual product users. We do not recommend making changes directly in your production workspace. It will safeguard you from accidentally sending a test notification to your production users.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a workflow">
    Workflow houses the automation logic of your notification. Each workflow starts with a trigger, processes the defined logic, and sends one or more messages to the end user. You can create a workflow from SuprSend dashboard by clicking on **`+ Create workflow`** button on the [workflows tab](https://app.suprsend.com/en/sandbox/workflows).

    ![](/images/docs/d78be2d-image.png)

    To design a workflow, you need:

    1. **A Trigger point** - Trigger initiates the workflow. You can initiate it

       * [Using the direct workflow API](/docs/trigger-workflow#triggering-workflow-via-api), where you can include recipient channel information, preferences, and actor details directly in the trigger.

       * [By emitting an event](/docs/trigger-workflow#event-based-trigger): You can trigger these events from your frontend application or from your backend systems, depending on the use case. (note: the recipient needs to be pre-created for event-based triggers).

    2. **Delivery node** - Delivery nodes represent the channels where users will receive notifications. You can use:

        * [multi-channel](/docs/delivery-multi-channel) nodes, to send messages across multiple channels,

        * [smart channel routing](/docs/smart-delivery), to notify users sequentially rather than bombarding them on all channels at once (though it’s generally better to use).

        * Template in delivery node contains the content of the notification. You can add both static and dynamic content sourced from user properties or trigger payloads. We use handlebars as our Whatsapp templating language. You can add dynamic content as `{{var}}`.

          Add trigger data in the **mock** to get variable auto-suggestions during editing.
          Ensure to publish the template before using it in a workflow.

          [Learn more about how to design In-app Inbox template here](/docs/in-app-inbox-template).

    ![](https://files.readme.io/e5b9db7-template_edit.gif)

    3. **Functional nodes (Optional)** - These are the logic nodes in the workflow. You can use it to add delay, batch multiple notifications in a summary or add conditional branches in the workflow. [Check out all workflow nodes here.](/docs/delay)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Trigger the Workflow">
    You can trigger a test workflow directly from dashboard by clicking on '**`Test`**' button in your workflow editor or **"Commit"** changes to trigger it from your code. We follow Git like versioning for workflow changes, so you need to commit your changes to trigger new workflow via the API. You can [check all methods of triggering workflow here](/docs/trigger-workflow).

    To trigger a workflow, you need:

    1. **Recipient** - End user who would be notified in the workflow run. Recipient is uniquely identified by `distinct_id` within SuprSend and must have the relevant channel identity set in their profile. You can define recipient inline in case of API based trigger or [create user profile](/docs/users#creating-user-profile-on-suprsend) first for event based trigger.In Sandbox environment, a sample user with your registered email ID is pre-created for testing. You can always add more users or edit existing user profile from subscriber page on UI.

    2. **Data or Event Properties** - This will be used to render dynamic content in the template (added in template mock) or variables in the workflow configuration.

    We'll be triggering the workflow with direct API trigger for quick testing. You can [check all trigger methods here.](/docs/trigger-workflow)



    **Sample Payload for API based trigger:**

    You can get workspace key, secret or API key for trigger from [Settings tab -> API keys ](https://app.suprsend.com/en/sandbox/developers/api-keys). Inbox channel is automatically updated in user profile on user creation. So, you won't need to pass Inbox channel in your trigger call.

  <Step title="Check logs to see the status of your sent notification">
    Once triggered, you can monitor the request and it's status on the "Requests" tab, and view step-by-step debugging of each execution on the "Execution" tab inside workflow.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Integrate Inbox in your product">
    We have ready UI codes to add In-App Inbox in your web and mobile application. All you have to do is copy the code into your project and you are good to go. Here are respective codes and example apps to implement Inbox as per your tech stack.

    **Authenticate user to access their Inbox feed:**

    You'll have to secure your user access with [HMAC authentication](/docs/hmac-authentication) to prevent unauthorized access to any user's Inbox feed, as it can contain personal information and can lead to data breach.&#x20;

    With HMAC authentication, you generate a unique unguessable `subscriber_id` in your server-side code. All you have to do is pass `distinct_id` of the user (a unique identifier of user in your database, preferably a numeric code or UUID) and Shared Secret key available on your [Inbox vendor page](https://app.suprsend.com/en/production/vendors/inbox/suprsend-inbox?_gl=1*118hmho*_gcl_au*MjA5MDI1NTk2NC4xNzE1NDM5MzUyLjEzMTY5MDkyODUuMTcyMjAwNjE5Ny4xNzIyMDA2MTk2*_ga*MTM5NTM1NDk2NC4xNzE4NzE0Njk4*_ga_PPDYBESP2L*MTcyMjAxNzg5NS45Ny4xLjE3MjIwMTk0MzcuNjAuMC4w).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Push to Production">
    In SuprSend, each environment is isolated, meaning workflows, users, and vendors are configured separately in testing and production workspaces. Also, you'll have to change the Inbox secret added in your server-side code to generate subscriber\_id for your productions users.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Follow this [go live checklist](/docs/go-live-checklist) to setup things in production once you are done testing.

With broadcast, you can send notifications to a large list of users with high throughput and low latency. You can use this to schedule campaigns or send important announcements that is relevant for a large group of users. Best used for cases when you want your messages to be delivered instantly like stock market alerts.

## Pre-requisites

[Create a list of users](/docs/lists)

List is a group of users who you want to send broadcast to.

## Triggering Broadcast

Once you have the list ready, you can trigger broadcast using one of the following methods:

### 1. Programmatically using SDK / API

This is the most flexible way of sending broadcast to a list. Use it when you regularly trigger a specific message to bulk users, like reminders or community updates like news. You can use [API](/reference/broadcast-overview) or update it using backend SDK

1. [Trigger broadcast using python SDK](/docs/python-broadcast)
2. [Trigger broadcast using node SDK](/docs/node-broadcast)
3. [Trigger broadcast using Java SDK](/docs/broadcast-java)
4. [Trigger broadcast using Go SDK](/docs/broadcast-go)

### 2. From UI

You can also trigger Broadcast directly from the SuprSend dashboard without any tech involvement. Recommended for cases when you want to send a one-off campaign, something like newsletter or special feature announcement.

You can schedule broadcast on a list from the dashboard by clicking on "**Run Broadcast**" option in the kebab menu on **Subscriber -> Lists** tab

description: "This is a quick setup guide to start sending MS Teams notifications with SuprSend."
---

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create SuprSend account">
    Simply [signup](https://auth.suprsend.com/sign-up) on SuprSend to create your account. If you already have your company account setup, ask your admin to invite you to the team.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create MS Teams App">
    To activate MS Teams Integration, you'll have to [create a Teams App](/docs/microsoft-teams#step-1-create-teams-app) and [add integration in SuprSend vendor page](/docs/microsoft-teams#step-2-add-teams-integration-on-suprsend).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test directly in Staging workspace">
    <Note>
      📘 Since, Teams channel need the app integration beforehand for testing, you can only test it in Staging Workspace. 
    </Note>
    #### Different workspaces and their usage

    You'll see 3 workspaces in your SuprSend account: Sandbox, Staging and Production. Workspaces can be switched from top navigation bar.

    - **Sandbox** is setup for quick testing with sample workflow, a sample user with your registered email and pre-configured channels (email, SMS, WhatsApp, Inbox) for quick testing. It's ideal for quick exploration and testing and is available for limited period.
    - **Staging** is your development workspace. You'll do all your iterations and testing in this workspace before pushing it to production.
    - **Production** workspace is where you'll configure your live notifications and sync your actual product users. We do not recommend making changes directly in your production workspace. It will safeguard you from accidentally sending a test notification to your production users.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a workflow">
    Workflow houses the automation logic of your notification. Each workflow starts with a trigger, processes the defined logic, and sends one or more messages to the end user. You can create a workflow from SuprSend dashboard by clicking on  button on the [workflows tab](https://app.suprsend.com/en/sandbox/workflows).

    To design a workflow, you need:

    1. **A Trigger point** - Trigger initiates the workflow. You can initiate it
       - [Using the direct workflow API](/docs/trigger-workflow#triggering-workflow-via-api), where you can include recipient channel information, preferences, and actor details directly in the trigger.
       - [By emitting an event](/docs/trigger-workflow#event-based-trigger): You can trigger these events from your frontend application or from your backend systems, depending on the use case. (note: the recipient needs to be pre-created for event-based triggers).
    2. **Delivery node** - Delivery nodes represent the channels where users will receive notifications. You can use:
         
        - [multi-channel](/docs/delivery-multi-channel) nodes to send messages across multiple channels, 
         
        - [smart channel routing](/docs/smart-delivery) to notify users sequentially rather than bombarding them on all channels at once (though it’s generally better to use).

        - **Template** in delivery node contains the content of the notification. You can add both static and dynamic content sourced from user properties or trigger payloads. You can choose to edit in markdown or JSONNET format. For simple text messages, use markdown (add variables in handlebars format as `{{var}}`) and for complex adaptive card designs, you can use [JSONNET](https://jsonnet.org/ref/language.html) editor. Variables can be added as `data.var` or `data["$batched_events"][0].var` for batched alerts in JSONNET editor.Ensure to publish the template before using it in a workflow. 
          
          [Learn how to design MS Teams template here](/docs/ms-teams-template).

    ![](https://files.readme.io/e5b9db7-template_edit.gif)
    3. **Functional nodes (Optional)** - These are the logic nodes in the workflow. You can use it to add delay, batch multiple notifications in a summary or add conditional branches in the workflow. [Check out all workflow nodes here.](/docs/delay)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Trigger the workflow">
    You can trigger a test workflow directly from dashboard by clicking on '`Text`' button in your workflow editor or **"Commit"** changes to trigger it from your code. We follow Git like versioning for workflow changes, so you need to commit your changes to trigger new workflow via the API. You can [check all methods of triggering workflow here](/docs/trigger-workflow).

    To trigger a workflow, you need:

    1. **Recipient** - End user who would be notified in the workflow run. Recipient is uniquely identified by `distinct_id` within SuprSend and must have the relevant channel identity set in their profile. You can define recipient inline in case of API based trigger or [create user profile](/docs/users#creating-user-profile-on-suprsend) first for event based trigger.
    2. **Data or Event Properties** - This will be used to render dynamic content in the template (added in template mock) or variables in the workflow configuration.

    We'll be triggering the workflow with direct API trigger for quick testing. You can [check all trigger methods here.](/docs/trigger-workflow)

    #### Sample Payload for API based trigger

    You can get workspace key, secret or API key for trigger from [Settings tab -> API keys ](https://app.suprsend.com/en/sandbox/developers/api-keys). Here, we are defining MS teams channel inline using `conversation_id` and `tenant_id`. Refer this doc on how to get conversation_id and tenant_id for your teams account. Service URL will change depending on your region. Example service URL -

  <Step title="Check logs to see the status of your sent notification">
    Once triggered, you can monitor the request and it's status on the '`Requests`' tab, and view step-by-step debugging of each execution on the '`Execution`' tab inside workflow.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Push to Production">
    In SuprSend, each environment is isolated, meaning workflows, users, and vendors are configured separately in testing and production workspaces.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Follow this [go live checklist](/docs/go-live-checklist) to setup things in production once you are done testing.

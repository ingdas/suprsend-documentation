<Warning>

**End of support for [@suprsend/react-inbox](https://github.com/suprsend/suprsend-react-inbox/blob/main/docs/intergration.md). Migrate to `@suprsend/react`**

We have upgraded authentication of inbox from HMAC to JWT as it is more secure. Please [migrate](https://docs.suprsend.com/docs/react-migration-guide) to newer SDK if you are on old one.

</Warning>

There are 2 ways in which you can implement inbox/feed functionality:

- **Drop-in components:** Pre-built UI with many customizable options which require minimal effort to build. For setup please refer [docs](http://localhost:3000/docs/react-in-app-feed).
- **Headless implementation:** For more advanced use cases where you want to build UI/UX from scratch. For setup please refer [docs](http://localhost:3000/docs/react-sdk-headless-feed).

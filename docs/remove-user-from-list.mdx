You can use this node to dynamically remove recipient or actor from the list. You can use it for use cases like when someone unsubscribes from an event or completes an action, you can remove them from the notification list to stop sending them further alerts.

### Compute List ID at runtime

You can either add users to a pre-defined list or dynamically render list ID during workflow execution. Dynamic list are defined in handlebars format as `{{...}}`.

One common use-case of computing list ID dynamically is when you have different lists based on user topic subscription. For example, there are multiple events happening and you have separate list for each event. List ID in such case can be `{{event_id}}_subscribers` and List name `{{event_name}} - subscribers`.

<Warning>
  There should be an existing list with the ID computed during trigger else this action will fail.

### Lists vs. Objects for topic subscriptions

* [Lists](/docs/lists) are ideal for one-time broadcasts to large user groups with high throughput (up to 1000 notifications/second). Example: Sending announcements or updates to all users subscribed to a particular event.

* [Objects](/docs/objects) are better for reusable topic subscriptions when additional workflows need to be triggered for the same subscribers. Example: Notifying team members or running nested workflows for hierarchical subscribers.

SuprSend Python SDK installation

Open Recipe

## Installation

**Step 1:** Install `libmagic` system package. You can skip this step if you already have this package installed in your system. You can install it as follows:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell bash
  # if you are using linux / debian based systems
  sudo apt install libmagic

  # If you are using macOS
  brew install libmagic
  ```
</CodeGroup>

**Step 2:** Install `suprsend-py-sdk` using pip

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell bash
  $ pip install suprsend-py-sdk

  # to upgrade to latest SDK version

  $ pip install suprsend-py-sdk --upgrade
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Check>
  If your python3 version is lower than 3.7, upgrade it to >=3.7
</Check>

## Initialization

For initializing SDK, you need **WORKSPACE KEY** and **WORKSPACE SECRET**.

<CodeGroup>
  ```python python
  from suprsend import Suprsend
  # Initialize SDK
  supr_client = Suprsend("WORKSPACE KEY", "WORKSPACE SECRET")
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Replace **WORKSPACE KEY** and **WORKSPACE SECRET** with your workspace values. You will get both the tokens from [Suprsend dashboard](https://app.suprsend.com/) (***Settings page -> "API keys"*** section). For more details, check the [documentation on 'Workspaces'](/docs/workspace).

## Installation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install 'libmagic' system package. ">
    You can skip this step if you already have this package installed in your system.

    <CodeGroup>

    ```shell bash
    # if you are using linux / debian based systems
    sudo apt install libmagic

    # If you are using macOS
    brew install libmagic
    ```

    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install 'suprsend-py-sdk' using pip">
    <CodeGroup>

    ```shell bash
    $ pip install suprsend-py-sdk

    # to upgrade to latest SDK version

    $ pip install suprsend-py-sdk --upgrade
    ```

    </CodeGroup>

    <Check>
      **Python version 3.7 or later is required**

      If your python3 version is lower than 3.7, upgrade it.
    </Check>

    <Note>
      **Schema Validation Support**: If you're using [schema validation](/docs/validate-workflow-payload) for workflow payloads, you need Python SDK v0.15.0 or later. The API response format was modified to support schema validation, and older SDK versions may not properly handle validation errors.
    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Initialization

For initializing SDK, you need workspace_key and workspace_secret. You will get both the tokens from your [Suprsend dashboard](https://app.suprsend.com/en/production/developers/api-keys) (Developers -> API Keys).

<CodeGroup>

```python python
from suprsend import Suprsend
# Initialize SDK
supr_client = Suprsend("WORKSPACE KEY", "WORKSPACE SECRET")
```

</CodeGroup>

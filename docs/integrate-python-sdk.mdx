## Installation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install 'libmagic' system package. ">
    You can skip this step if you already have this package installed in your system.

    <CodeGroup>
      ```shell bash
      # if you are using linux / debian based systems
      sudo apt install libmagic

      # If you are using macOS
      brew install libmagic
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install 'suprsend-py-sdk' using pip">
    <CodeGroup>
      ```shell bash
      $ pip install suprsend-py-sdk

      # to upgrade to latest SDK version

      $ pip install suprsend-py-sdk --upgrade
      ```
    </CodeGroup>

    <Check>
      **Python version 3.7 or later is required**

      If your python3 version is lower than 3.7, upgrade it.
    </Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Initialization

For initializing SDK, you need **`WORKSPACE KEY`** and **`WORKSPACE SECRET`**. You will get both the tokens from your [Suprsend dashboard](https://app.suprsend.com/en/production/developers/api-keys) (Developers -> API Keys).

<CodeGroup>
  ```python python
  from suprsend import Suprsend
  # Initialize SDK
  supr_client = Suprsend("WORKSPACE KEY", "WORKSPACE SECRET")
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Configuring Open/Click tracking for emails on Postmark

SuprSend uses webhooks to update notification statuses on delivery, user actions like open/click or the failure scenarios. This allows SuprSend to power your notification analytics. To allow SuprSend to receive these events via webhook, add SuprSend's webhook URL in your Postmark account.

* Go to Postmark -> servers -> select your server -> select your stream -> webhooks -> add webhook

![](/images/docs/23d0698-Screenshot_2024-03-30_at_1.32.21_AM.png)

* On **Add webhook**, settings page, add [`https://hub.suprsend.com/webhook/postmark/`](https://hub.suprsend.com/webhook/postmark/) in webhook URL section and enable all events on Postmark.

## How to add Unsubscription link in email

You can directly add unsubscription link in your email using [`$hosted_preference_url`](/docs/user-preferences#hosted-preference-page) variable in your template. This link directs users to the [SuprSend preference page](/docs/user-preferences). With SuprSend preference setting, you have the flexibility to create multiple notification categories based on the type of notifications. This allows users to opt-out of specific notification categories, providing them with granular control over their preferences compared to other email services where they can only opt-out from all marketing communications at once.

**Why it's important to give unsubscribe option in email?**

First, it is required by the [CAN-Spam Act](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/can-spam-act-compliance-guide-business). Second, if you don’t give them this option, they are more likely to click on the spam complaint button, which will cause more harm than allowing them to unsubscribe. Finally, many ESPs look for unsubscribe links and are more likely to filter your email if they don’t have them.

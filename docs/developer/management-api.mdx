## Overview

The **SuprSend Management API** lets you programmatically manage assets such as:  Workflows, Templates, Schemas, Translations.  

This API is designed for **asset management** and **cross-workspace operations** (e.g., promoting workflows from Staging → Production).  

<Note>
The Management API only provides access to resources managed in the **SuprSend Dashboard**.  

For all other operations (e.g., users, triggering workflows, managing tenants or preferences), use the [REST API Reference](/reference/overview).
</Note>

## Authentication  

Management APIs require a **Service Token** for authentication.  
Generate one from [**Dashboard → Account Settings → Service Tokens**](https://app.suprsend.com/en/account-settings/service-tokens).  

Include the token in the `Authorization` header as `ServiceToken <YOUR_SERVICE_TOKEN>`:  

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: ServiceToken <YOUR_SERVICE_TOKEN>" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     https://management-api.suprsend.com/v1/workflows
```

### Verify authentication

Run a test request with your Service Token:
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: ServiceToken <YOUR_SERVICE_TOKEN>" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     https://management-api.suprsend.com/v1/workflows
```

## Versioning Policy

SuprSend's SDK versioning policy is based on the **[Semantic Versioning (SemVer)](https://semver.org/)** standard. For example, in version 4.3.2, 4 is the **major**, 3 is the **minor**, and 2 is the **patch**.

**Major.** Breaking changes that are backward incompatible (e.g., renaming SDK exception classes).

**Minor.** New features that are backward compatible (e.g., adding new methods or optional parameters).

**Patch.** Backward-compatible bug fixes (e.g., fixing file upload listing issues).

Each SDK version is coupled with the API version that was current at the time of release. This ensures stable and predictable API behavior across versions.

## Support Policy

All new features, performance improvements, and bug fixes are released on the latest major version of each SDK. Older major versions remain functional, but updates are only rolled out to the most recent major release.

SuprSend maintains backward compatibility across all SDKs, ensuring existing integrations continue to work as expected. However, we recommend upgrading to the latest version to take advantage of improved authorization mechanisms (especially in frontend SDKs), better performance, and access to new API capabilities.

Our release cycle is synchronized with product development milestones, so SDK and API versions evolve together. This ensures consistent behavior across the platform and prevents breaking changes in existing implementations.

Comprehensive migration guides are provided for each major version upgrade, helping you transition with minimal code changes and predictable results.

### Migration Guides

We provide migration guides to help you upgrade from older major SDK versions. You can find them in our documentation:

- [Migration guide from v1](/docs/migration-guide-from-v1)
- [React migration guide](/docs/react-migration-guide)
- [Web SDK migration guide](/docs/migration-guide-from-v1)

## Language Support Policy

We currently support all SDK languages without any deprecation timeline. In the unlikely event of deprecating a language or version in the future, advance notice will be provided to ensure sufficient migration time.

### Language Support Status

| Language | Version | Status | Support Level |
|----------|---------|--------|---------------|
| **Node.js** | 14+ | ✅ Active | Full Support |
| **JavaScript** | All Versions | ✅ Active | Full Support |
| **React** | 16.8+ | ✅ Active | Full Support |
| **Python** | 3.9+ | ✅ Active | Full Support |
| **Java** | 8+ | ✅ Active | Full Support |
| **Go** | 1.18+ | ✅ Active | Full Support |
| **Swift** | iOS 15+ | ✅ Active | Full Support |
| **Kotlin** | Android (all versions) | ✅ Active | Full Support |
| **React Native** | All Versions | ✅ Active | Full Support |
| **Flutter** | >=2.5.0 | ✅ Active | Full Support |

<Info>
All supported language versions receive full support with no deprecation timeline. This includes regular updates, security patches, and comprehensive documentation.

## Release Policy

We follow agile methodologies to ensure rapid and flexible development.

**Roadmap Features:** Features are released as soon as development and testing are complete, typically at a rate of ~1-2 per week. There is no fixed release day. We prioritize user feedback and market needs when planning feature releases.

**Versions in Backend SDKs:** New versions are released mainly for new API additions. User-facing APIs will always be backward compatible. We maintain comprehensive API versioning to ensure smooth transitions for existing integrations.

**Frontend SDKs:** We incrementally add features in frontend SDKs such as Inbox, and release depends on our roadmap. Frontend updates focus on enhancing user experience and adding interactive capabilities.

**Bug Fixes & Improvements:** Bug fixes are prioritized and released as soon as they are identified. Critical security fixes are released immediately, while minor improvements are batched for regular releases.

**Communication:** Releases are announced on our [Slack community](https://suprsend.com/slack), in-app and via [email newsletters](https://suprsend.com/newsletter). Important features are also communicated directly in shared groups. We provide detailed changelogs and migration guides for major updates.

<Note>
💡 **Pro tip:** Start with patch upgrades before moving to minor or major versions to minimize risk.

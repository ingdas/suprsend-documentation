---

SuprSend **Management APIs** (used to manage assets like workflows, templates, schemas, etc.) use **Service Token authentication** instead of the regular API Key authentication.  

- **Service Tokens** are created at the **account level**, not per workspace.  
- They are designed for **cross-workspace operations**, such as promoting assets from **Staging → Production**.  
- Unlike API Keys, Service Tokens are **not tied to notification delivery**, but strictly to **management operations**.  

---

## Generating a Service Token  

1. Navigate to **[SuprSend Dashboard → Account Settings → Service Tokens](https://app.suprsend.com/en/account-settings/service-tokens)**  
2. Click **Generate a new Token**.  
3. Provide a **descriptive name** (e.g., `staging-to-prod-promotion`).  
4. Click **Create and View**.  
5. Copy and store the token securely — it is shown **only once** at generation.  

<Warning>Service Tokens give access to all workspaces in your account. Store them in environment variables or a secure vault and never commit them to source control.</Warning>

## Using Service Tokens in Management APIs  

To authenticate a Management API request, include the Service Token in the `Authorization` header using the `ServiceToken` scheme:  

```http
Authorization: ServiceToken <SERVICE_TOKEN>
Content-Type: application/json
```

### Example (cURL):
```curl 
  -X POST "https://management-api.suprsend.com/management/workflows/import" \
  -H "Authorization: ServiceToken <SERVICE_TOKEN>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"workflow_id": "order-confirmation", "source": "staging", "destination": "production"}'
```

The **SuprSend REST API** enables you to sync user data and send notifications at scale.  

We have [SDKs](/docs/developer/sdk-overview) for most popular languages. If your backend or frontend is built in another language or you prefer direct integration, you can use the REST API to programmatically interact with SuprSend.

## Authentication  

REST APIs require an **API Key** for authentication. API Keys are scoped **per workspace** (e.g., Sandbox, Staging, Production), ensuring isolation across environments.  

Include your API Key in the `Authorization` header as a `Bearer` token: 
```http
Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>
Content-Type: application/json
```

## API Reference

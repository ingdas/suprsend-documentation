## How to get API Key from Mailgun account

Once logged in to your Mailgun account, navigate to [API Security](https://app.mailgun.com/settings/api_security) from your profile.

![](/images/docs/ea0ce31-image.png)

Private API key can be seen only at the time of creation. You can either use any of your existing keys or **"Add new key"**.

<Warning>
  **🚧  User role to read API keys:**

  Users with "developer" or "admin" role can only read the API keys. Please check with relevant folks in your team if you are not able to see the API keys in your account
</Warning>

## Setting Callback URL in Mailgun Account

One of the platform advantage of using SuprSend as a central communication system is that it shows notification analytics for all channels in your SuprSend account together.

Go to **`Sending->Webhooks->Add webhook`**

Add below URL for all event types (`Delivered Messages`, `Clicks`, `Opens`, `Spam Complaints`, `Permanent Failure`, `Temporary Failure`)

> URL: [`https://hub.suprsend.com/webhook/mailgun/`](https://hub.suprsend.com/webhook/mailgun/)

You can add "Unsubscribe" link to your email by enabling **Unsubscribes** in *Sending -> Domain settings (Tracking section)*

## How to add Unsubscription link in email

It's recommended to allow recipients to unsubscribe from emails. You can either:

1. **Use your vendor's unsubscribe link** by enabling **Unsubscribes** in *Sending → Domain settings (Tracking section)*. This opts users out of all emails from that vendor.

2. **Use SuprSend’s** [**hosted preference page** ](/docs/preferences#hosted-preference-page)for more granular control, allowing users to manage preferences per category while also reducing unnecessary vendor API calls for opt-outs.

**Why it's important to give unsubscribe option in email?**

First, it is required by the [CAN-Spam Act](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/can-spam-act-compliance-guide-business). Second, if you don’t give them this option, they are more likely to click on the spam complaint button, which will cause more harm than allowing them to unsubscribe. Finally, many ESPs look for unsubscribe links and are more likely to filter your email if they don’t have them.

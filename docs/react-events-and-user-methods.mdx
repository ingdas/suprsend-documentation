### 1. Integrate SuprSendProvider

Integrate [SuprSendProvider](https://docs.suprsend.com/docs/react-1#suprsendprovider) as it is needed for creating SuprSend Client and authenticating user.

### 2. Call useSuprSendClient hook to access client instance

Call [useSuprSendClient](https://docs.suprsend.com/docs/react-1#usesuprsendclient) hook in your react component code to get SuprSend client instance which has all event and user update methods.

### 3. Call track and user update methods.

Please refer these sections to call [events](https://docs.suprsend.com/docs/js-events-and-user-methods#trigger-events) and [user update](https://docs.suprsend.com/docs/js-events-and-user-methods#update-user-profile) methods in your react application, as integration steps are same for both the web-sdk and react-sdk.

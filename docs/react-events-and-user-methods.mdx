<Step title="Call useSuprSendClient hook to access client instance">

Call [useSuprSendClient](https://docs.suprsend.com/docs/react-1#usesuprsendclient) hook in your react component code to get SuprSend client instance which has all event and user update methods.

<Step title="Call track and user update methods.">

Please refer these sections to call [events](https://docs.suprsend.com/docs/js-events-and-user-methods#trigger-events) and [user update](https://docs.suprsend.com/docs/js-events-and-user-methods#update-user-profile) methods in your react application, as integration steps are same for both the web-sdk and react-sdk.

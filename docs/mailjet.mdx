## Configuring Open/Click tracking for emails on Mailjet

SuprSend uses webhooks to update notification statuses on delivery, user actions like open/click or the failure scenarios. This allows SuprSend to track notification status in logs and to power analytics. To allow SuprSend to receive these events via webhook, add SuprSend's webhook URL in your Mailjet account.

SuprSend's webhook URL: `https://hub.suprsend.com/webhook/mailjet/`

1. Go to Mailjet Account Settings Page from the top profile and select **Rest API -> Event Notifications (Webhooks)**

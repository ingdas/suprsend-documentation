---

This guide explains how to model multi-tenant recruiting platforms (ATS) and hiring platforms in SuprSend, with tenant-specific branding, preferences, and vendor routing.

<Note>
**Example scenario:** We'll use **Uber** as our example—a customer company running a Backend Engineer hiring pipeline (Jan 2026) that sends interview notifications with Uber branding, not the platform's branding.

This pattern is common in B2B2C platforms where users interact with the platform, but all notifications must appear to come from the customer company they're engaging with.
</Note>

---

## Company Structure

ATS platforms typically organize notifications using a hierarchy:

<Card title="Notification hierarchy" icon="sitemap">
  **Generic structure:**
  ```
  Customer Company (Tenant) → Job / Role → Hiring Stage → Notification Type
  ```

  **Uber example:**
  ```
  Uber → Backend Engineer → Interview Scheduled → Candidate Email
  ```
</Card>

This hierarchy helps you design notifications that scale across multiple customer companies without duplicating templates or workflows.

<Info>
**Ownership model:** The platform owns orchestration and infrastructure, while the customer company (tenant) owns branding, preferences, and delivery channels.
</Info>

**Components:**

- **Customer Company (Tenant):** Uber—customer organization with branding
- **Job / Role:** Backend Engineer—specific position being filled
- **Hiring Stage:** Interview Scheduled—step in the hiring process
- **Notification Type:** Candidate Email—individual notification (application received, interview scheduled, offer extended)

---

## Concept Mapping

How ATS platform concepts map to SuprSend:

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
      <th>ATS Platform</th>
      <th>SuprSend</th>
      <th>Example</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Customer Company</strong></td>
          <td><strong>Tenant</strong></td>
      <td>Uber tenant</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
      <td><strong>Notification Type</strong></td>
      <td><strong>Template</strong></td>
      <td>Interview scheduled email template</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Orchestration Steps</strong></td>
          <td><strong>Dynamic Workflow</strong></td>
      <td>Application received and interview scheduled are triggered separately</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
      <td><strong>Candidate</strong></td>
          <td><strong>User</strong></td>
      <td>Candidate with email, phone number</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Company-level Controls</strong></td>
      <td><strong>Notification Categories</strong></td>
      <td>`hiring.interview_updates`</td>
    </tr>
        <tr>
      <td><strong>Candidate Preferences</strong></td>
      <td><strong>User Preferences</strong></td>
      <td>Candidate opt-in/out</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

<Info>
**Tags (optional):** Tags can be used to group notifications logically (for example, all hiring-related messages) without affecting user-facing preferences. Tags are optional and not part of preference logic.
</Info>

<Warning>
**Template Variants:** If you need campaign-specific content today, pass it via the `data` field. Variants API (v2.0) is in beta. [Contact support →](mailto:support@suprsend.com)
</Warning>

## Setup Steps

### 1. Create Tenants

Create a tenant for each customer company programmatically using the SuprSend API or SDK. For Uber, include their logo URL, brand colors, company name, timezone, and contact information.

**Required fields:**

<Card title="Example: Uber tenant configuration" icon="settings">
  <ul>
    <li><strong>tenant_id:</strong> <code>uber</code> (unique identifier)</li>
    <li><strong>tenant_name:</strong> Uber (display name)</li>
    <li><strong>logo:</strong> https://assets.yourdomain.com/tenants/uber/logo.png (branding)</li>
    <li><strong>primary_color:</strong> #000000 (branding)</li>
    <li><strong>timezone:</strong> America/Los_Angeles (localization)</li>
  </ul>
</Card>

<Tip>
**Programmatic creation:** Create tenants automatically when new customer companies sign up. Use the SDK to create tenants with their branding information during onboarding.
</Tip>

📘 [Tenants →](/docs/tenants) | [Node.js SDK →](/docs/node-tenants) | [Python SDK →](/docs/python-tenants)

---

### 2. Create Notification Categories

Create categories mapping to your ATS platform's notification types. Use **Sections** for product areas and **Sub-categories** for notification types.

**Category structure:**
- **Section:** Product area (e.g., `hiring`)
- **Sub-category:** Notification type (e.g., `interview_updates`)

<Card title="Category examples for Uber" icon="tag">
  <ul>
    <li><code>hiring.application_updates</code> → Application status updates</li>
    <li><code>hiring.interview_updates</code> → Interview scheduling and reminders</li>
    <li><code>hiring.offer_updates</code> → Offer letters and negotiations</li>
  </ul>
</Card>

<Tip>
Group similar notifications together. For Uber's Backend Engineer hiring pipeline, group all interview steps (scheduled, reminder, rescheduled) under `hiring.interview_updates` instead of separate categories.
</Tip>

📘 [Notification Categories →](/docs/notification-category) | [Create categories →](https://app.suprsend.com/en/staging/developers/preference-categories)

---

### 3. Configure Preferences

SuprSend uses a four-layer preference system to determine which channels are used for each notification:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Universal Set (U)" icon="globe">
    All categories defined by your platform
  </Card>
  <Card title="Tenant Visibility (T1)" icon="eye">
    Categories visible to Uber
  </Card>
  <Card title="Tenant Admin (T2)" icon="user-shield">
    Uber admins can disable categories/channels
  </Card>
  <Card title="Candidate Preferences (S)" icon="user">
    Candidates opt-in/out at category/channel level
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

**How it works:**

SuprSend determines final delivery channels by progressively applying platform rules, company controls, and candidate preferences.

**Evaluation formula:** `Final Channels = U ∩ T1 ∩ T2 ∩ S`

To make a category mandatory, set "Can't Unsubscribe" on the Notification Category.

<Card title="Example: Channel evaluation" icon="filter">
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Platform (U):</strong> Email ✅, SMS ✅, WhatsApp ✅</li>
    <li><strong>Uber visibility:</strong> Email ✅, SMS ✅, WhatsApp ✅</li>
    <li><strong>Uber admin:</strong> Email ✅, SMS ❌, WhatsApp ✅</li>
    <li><strong>Candidate:</strong> Email ✅, SMS ✅, WhatsApp ❌</li>
    <li><strong>Final result:</strong> <strong>Email ✅ only</strong></li>
  </ul>
</Card>

<Info>
Critical notifications like interview updates are typically marked as mandatory to ensure candidates don't miss time-sensitive updates, while marketing or job recommendation messages remain optional.
</Info>

#### Expose Preferences to Customer Companies

Allow customer companies like Uber, Airbnb, and Indeed to manage their notification preferences through your platform.

**Recommended approach:** Build an admin page in your app that calls SuprSend's Tenant Preference APIs. This gives you full control over the UI and integrates with your existing admin dashboard.

**Optional:** Embed SuprSend's preference UI for faster rollout if you don't need custom styling.

<Note>
**Preference exposure:** Customer admins can control which notification categories are visible to their organization and which channels are enabled/disabled. This gives them control over their notification strategy while maintaining platform-level governance.
</Note>

---

### 4. Create Templates

Create templates for each notification type. For Uber's interview scheduling, create `INTERVIEW_SCHEDULED_EMAIL`. Use tenant variables for automatic branding.

<Note>
**Template reuse:** Templates are created once by the platform and rendered at send time with tenant-specific branding. This avoids creating duplicate templates per customer while still ensuring fully branded communication.
</Note>

**Naming convention:** `{NOTIFICATION_TYPE}_{CHANNEL}`

Examples: `INTERVIEW_SCHEDULED_EMAIL`, `OFFER_EXTENDED_SMS`, `APPLICATION_RECEIVED_PUSH`

**Template variables:**

```handlebars
// Data variables
{{job_title}}              → "Backend Engineer"
{{interview_date}}         → "2026-01-15"
{{interviewer_name}}       → "Sarah Chen"

// Tenant branding
{{$tenant.logo}}          → Uber logo URL
{{$tenant.primary_color}}  → "#000000"
{{$tenant.tenant_name}}    → "Uber"

// Recipient info
{{$recipient.name}}       → "John Doe"
{{$recipient.email}}      → "john@example.com"
```

When Uber triggers an interview notification, SuprSend automatically applies Uber's branding.

#### Expose Templates to Customer Applications

One common approach is to allow customer companies to customize templates through embeddable templates.

**How it works:**

- **Template fetching:** Customers fetch templates by `template_slug`. Pass `tenant_id` and `language` to get qualified variants—if a tenant-specific variant exists, it's returned; otherwise, the default variant is shown.
- **Variant creation:** Customers can edit existing variants or create new tenant-specific variants. When creating tenant variants, set conditions like `$tenant.id = "uber"`.

**Template structure:**

Templates use standardized snake_case fields and handlebars variables (e.g., `{{variable}}`). All channels (email, SMS, WhatsApp, push) follow consistent structures. SuprSend automatically selects the most specific variant based on tenant ID, language, and custom conditions.

**Benefits:**

- **Tenant isolation:** Changes made by Uber won't affect Airbnb's templates
- **Platform control:** Your platform maintains template structure and approval workflows
- **Self-service:** Customers can customize content without engineering support

<Tip>
For channels requiring approval (WhatsApp, SMS DLT), templates must be approved before going live. For more details on template embedding, see the [Embeddable Template Editor →](/docs/embeddable-templates) guide.

### 5. Choose Workflow Strategy

Choose between Native Workflows (visual builder) and Dynamic Workflows (programmatic triggers) based on your needs.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Native Workflows">
    SuprSend owns orchestration. Build workflows visually in the dashboard with drag-and-drop nodes, conditions, and delays.

    **When to use:**
    - Non-engineers need to create or modify workflows
    - Customer admins need visibility into notification flows
    - You want visual workflow management without code changes
    - Product or marketing teams need self-service workflow creation

    **Use cases:**
    - Marketing campaigns that change frequently
    - Onboarding sequences managed by product teams
    - Customer admins customizing their notification flows
    - Workflows that need frequent A/B testing

    <CardGroup cols={2}>
      <Card title="Advantages" icon="check-circle">
        - Visual builder<br/>
        - No code required<br/>
        - Self-service for non-technical teams
      </Card>
      <Card title="Trade-offs" icon="info-circle">
        - Less flexible than code<br/>
        - Dashboard access needed<br/>
        - Limited programmatic control
      </Card>
    </CardGroup>

    📘 [Workflows →](/docs/workflows)
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Dynamic Workflows">
    Your platform owns orchestration. Trigger workflows programmatically from your application when events occur.

    **When to use:**
    - Your platform already controls business logic
    - You need runtime workflow creation
    - Workflows are tightly integrated with your codebase
    - You want full programmatic control

    **Use cases:**
    - Hiring pipeline notifications (application received, interview scheduled, offer generated)
    - Transactional notifications triggered by user actions
    - Real-time event-driven notifications
    - Complex workflows with custom business logic

    **Required fields in trigger payload:**

    - `tenant_id` — Customer company identifier (required)
    - `recipient` — User identifiers (distinct_id, email, etc.)
    - `workflow` or `template` — Workflow/template identifier
    - `category` — Notification category (e.g., `hiring.interview_updates`)
    - `data` — Business data (job_title, interview_date, etc.)

    **Example payload:**

    ```json
    {
      "tenant_id": "uber",
      "category": "hiring.interview_updates",
      "recipient": {
        "distinct_id": "candidate_123",
        "email": "john@example.com"
      },
      "workflow": "interview_scheduled",
      "data": {
        "job_title": "Backend Engineer",
        "interview_date": "2026-01-15",
        "interviewer_name": "Sarah Chen"
      }
    }
    ```

    <CardGroup cols={2}>
      <Card title="Advantages" icon="check-circle">
        - Runtime creation<br/>
        - Faster go-live<br/>
        - Works with existing orchestration<br/>
        - Full programmatic control
      </Card>
      <Card title="Trade-offs" icon="info-circle">
        - No visual builder<br/>
        - Code changes required<br/>
        - Engineering team dependency
      </Card>
    </CardGroup>

    📘 [Dynamic Workflow Trigger →](/reference/dynamic-workflow-trigger)
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Tip>
Most ATS platforms start with Dynamic Workflows for core hiring notifications and introduce Native Workflows when non-technical teams need to manage marketing or campaign workflows.
</Tip>

### 6. Configure Tenant Vendors (Optional)

Enterprise customers may require their own SMTP servers for deliverability and compliance. For Uber, configure their SMTP as a tenant vendor so all notifications route through their infrastructure.

**When to use:**
- Customer requires their own SMTP domain for branding
- Compliance requirements (HIPAA, SOC 2, etc.)
- Deliverability concerns with shared infrastructure
- Customer has existing email infrastructure

<Info>
**Vendor fallback chain:** If Uber's SMTP fails, notifications automatically fall back to: Uber SMTP → Platform default SMTP (fallback)
</Info>

📘 [Tenant Vendors →](/docs/tenant-vendor) | [Vendor Fallback →](/docs/vendor-fallback)

---

## End-to-End Notification Flow

When Uber's platform triggers a Backend Engineer interview scheduled notification, SuprSend handles everything automatically:

<Steps>
  <Step title="1. Platform Identifies Tenant">
    Platform passes `tenant_id: "uber"` in the workflow trigger payload. SuprSend uses this to identify which customer company's branding and preferences to apply.
  </Step>
  <Step title="2. Apply Tenant Preferences">
    Checks Uber's defaults for `hiring.interview_updates`: Email enabled, SMS disabled, WhatsApp enabled.
  </Step>
  <Step title="3. Apply Candidate Preferences">
    Candidate opts out of WhatsApp → Final channels: Email only.
  </Step>
  <Step title="4. Resolve Template">
    Checks for a Jan 2026 variant. Falls back to `INTERVIEW_SCHEDULED_EMAIL` with Uber branding.
  </Step>
  <Step title="5. Render Branding">
    Applies Uber's logo, colors, and company name to template.
  </Step>
  <Step title="6. Route via Vendor">
    Routes through Uber's SMTP if configured, otherwise platform default.
  </Step>
  <Step title="7. Deliver">
    Email sent with Uber branding and interview details.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Other Common Scenarios

This data modeling approach applies to various multi-tenant marketplaces and platforms:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Travel booking platforms" icon="plane">
    Travelers receive confirmations branded by hotels/airlines, with tenant-specific preferences and vendor routing
  </Card>
  <Card title="Food delivery marketplaces" icon="utensils">
    Customers receive order updates branded by restaurants, each with their own branding and notification preferences
  </Card>
  <Card title="E-commerce marketplaces" icon="shopping-cart">
    Shoppers receive purchase confirmations branded by sellers, with per-seller branding and vendor configuration
  </Card>
  <Card title="Event ticketing platforms" icon="ticket">
    Attendees receive tickets branded by event organizers, with organizer-level preferences and custom SMTP
  </Card>
  <Card title="Learning platforms" icon="graduation-cap">
    Students receive course updates branded by educational institutions, with institution-specific branding and channels
  </Card>
  <Card title="Healthcare scheduling platforms" icon="heart">
    Patients receive appointment reminders branded by clinics, with clinic-level preferences and compliance routing
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
The same principles apply: end users interact with your platform, but notifications must reflect each customer's branding, preferences, and vendor routing.
</Note>

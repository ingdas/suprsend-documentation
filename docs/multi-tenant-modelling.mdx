title: "Design tenant-scoped notification architecture"
description: "Learn how to model multi-tenant notification architecture in SuprSend with tenant-level preferences, branding, templates, and vendor routing."
---

Multi-tenant platforms run a shared notification system across many customer organizations (tenants). The key requirement is tenant-specific customization: the same notification type must adapt based on tenant context—branding/sender, templates and localization, user preferences, and routing (channel + vendor).

In this guide, we'll show how to model this in SuprSend using a fictional employee engagement platform, **WorkVibe**. WorkVibe serves many companies and helps them run employee communications such as employee onboarding, performance reviews, pulse surveys, recognition messages, and policy updates.

<Note>
**Example scenario:** We'll use **Uber** as our example—a customer of WorkVibe, using the platform to run employee communications. WorkVibe's notification system must let its tenant Uber customize notifications, within WorkVibe's platform:

- Message templates provided by WorkVibe (content, tone, localization)
- Which channels (email, Slack, etc.) are used for communication
- Employee notification preferences
- Branding and sender identity for Uber (e.g., hr@uber.com)

—all while WorkVibe continues to operate a single shared, multi-tenant notification system.

This pattern is common in B2B2C platforms where users interact with the platform, but all notifications must appear to come from the customer company they're engaging with.
</Note>

---

## Understanding the Structure

WorkVibe organizes notifications using a clear hierarchy that scales across multiple customer companies:

<Card title="Notification hierarchy" icon="sitemap">
  **Generic structure:**
  ```
  Platform → Customer Company (Tenant) → Communication Type → Notification
  ```

  **WorkVibe example:**
  ```
  WorkVibe → Uber → Onboarding → New Employee Welcome Email
  ```
</Card>

This hierarchy helps you design notifications that scale across multiple customer companies without duplicating templates or workflows.

<Info>
**Ownership model:** The WorkVibe platform owns orchestration and infrastructure, while the customer company (tenant) owns branding, preferences, and delivery channels.
</Info>

## Setup Steps

Follow these steps to set up your tenant-scoped notification architecture:

### 1. Create Tenants

Create a tenant for each customer company programmatically using the SuprSend API or SDK. Each tenant stores branding attributes (logo, website, brand colors) along with any custom properties required for personalization.

**Required fields:**

<Card title="Example: Uber tenant configuration" icon="settings">
  <ul>
    <li><strong>tenant_id:</strong> <code>uber</code> (unique identifier)</li>
    <li><strong>tenant_name:</strong> Uber (display name)</li>
    <li><strong>logo:</strong> https://assets.yourdomain.com/tenants/uber/logo.png (branding)</li>
    <li><strong>primary_color:</strong> #000000 (branding)</li>
    <li><strong>timezone:</strong> America/Los_Angeles (localization)</li>
  </ul>
</Card>

Other than tenant properties, notification preferences and vendors can be customized at the per-tenant level.

<Tip>
**Programmatic creation:** Create tenants automatically when new customer companies sign up. Use the SDK to create tenants with their branding information during onboarding.

---

### 2. Create Notification Categories

Create categories mapping to your platform's notification types. These categories are linked to Workflows & Preferences. Use **Sections** for product areas and **Sub-categories** for notification types.

For WorkVibe, the notification category structure will look like:

**Category structure:**
- **Section:** Product area (e.g., `Onboarding & Lifecycle`, `Feedback & Engagement`)
- **Sub-category:** Notification type (e.g., `New Hire Welcome`, `First Week Check-in`, `Manager Feedback Request`)

<Card title="Category examples for WorkVibe" icon="tag">
  <ul>
    <li><code>onboarding.new_hire_welcome</code> → Welcome email sent on first day</li>
    <li><code>onboarding.first_week_checkin</code> → Check-in survey after first week</li>
    <li><code>feedback.manager_review_request</code> → Request for manager feedback</li>
    <li><code>engagement.pulse_survey</code> → Monthly employee pulse survey</li>
  </ul>
</Card>

<Tip>
Group similar notifications together for neatly organizing different notification types. Use `tags` in categories to filter categories within your application.
</Tip>

📘 [Notification Categories →](/docs/notification-category) | [Create categories →](https://app.suprsend.com/en/staging/developers/preference-categories)

---

### 3. Configure Preferences

SuprSend uses a four-layer preference system to determine which channels are used for each notification:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Universal Set (U)" icon="globe">
    All categories defined by your platform
  </Card>
  <Card title="Tenant Visibility (T1)" icon="eye">
    Categories visible to tenant
  </Card>
  <Card title="Tenant Admin (T2)" icon="user-shield">
    Tenant admins can disable categories/channels
  </Card>
  <Card title="End user Preferences (S)" icon="user">
    End users opt-in/out at category/channel level
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

**How it works:**

SuprSend determines final delivery channels by progressively applying platform rules, company controls, and employee preferences.

**Evaluation formula:** `Final Channels = U ∩ T1 ∩ T2 ∩ S`

To make a category mandatory, set "Can't Unsubscribe" on the Notification Category.

<Card title="Example: Channel evaluation" icon="filter">
  <ul>
    <li><strong>WorkVibe Platform (U):</strong> Email ✅, SMS ✅, Slack ✅</li>
    <li><strong>Uber visibility:</strong> Email ✅, SMS ✅, Slack ✅</li>
    <li><strong>Uber admin:</strong> Email ✅, SMS ❌, Slack ✅</li>
    <li><strong>Employee:</strong> Email ✅, SMS ✅, Slack ❌</li>
    <li><strong>Final result:</strong> <strong>Email ✅ only</strong></li>
  </ul>
</Card>

<Info>
Critical notifications like onboarding updates are typically marked as mandatory to ensure employees don't miss time-sensitive updates, while optional communications like marketing messages remain opt-in.
</Info>

#### Expose Preferences to Customer Companies

Allow customer companies like Uber to manage their notification preferences through your platform.

**Recommended approach:** Build an admin page in your application that calls SuprSend's Tenant Preference APIs. This gives you full control over the UI and integrates with your existing admin dashboard.

**Optional:** Embed SuprSend's preference UI for faster rollout if you don't need custom styling.

<Note>
**Preference exposure:** Customer admins can control which notification categories are visible to their organization and which channels are enabled/disabled. This gives them control over their notification strategy while maintaining platform-level governance.
</Note>

### 4. Create Templates

Create templates for each notification type. For Uber's new employee onboarding, create `NEW_HIRE_WELCOME_EMAIL`. Use tenant variables for automatic branding.

<Note>
**Template reuse:** Templates are created once by the platform and rendered at send time with tenant-specific branding. This avoids creating duplicate templates per customer while still ensuring fully branded communication.
</Note>

**Naming convention:** `{NOTIFICATION_TYPE}_{CHANNEL}`

Examples: `NEW_HIRE_WELCOME_EMAIL`, `FIRST_WEEK_CHECKIN_SLACK`, `PULSE_SURVEY_PUSH`

**Template variables:**

```handlebars
// Data variables
{{employee_name}}          → "Sarah Chen"
{{start_date}}              → "2026-01-15"
{{manager_name}}            → "John Doe"
{{company_department}}      → "Engineering"

// Tenant branding
{{$tenant.logo}}            → Uber logo URL
{{$tenant.primary_color}}   → "#000000"
{{$tenant.tenant_name}}     → "Uber"

// Recipient info
{{$recipient.name}}         → "Sarah Chen"
{{$recipient.email}}        → "sarah@uber.com"
```

When Uber triggers a new hire notification, SuprSend automatically applies Uber's branding.

#### Expose Templates to Customer Applications

One common approach is to allow customer companies to customize templates through embeddable templates.

**How it works:**

- **Template fetching:** Customers fetch templates by `template_slug`. Pass `tenant_id` and `language` to get qualified variants—if a tenant-specific variant exists, it's returned; otherwise, the default variant is shown.
- **Variant creation:** Customers can edit existing variants or create new tenant-specific variants. When creating tenant variants, set conditions like `$tenant.id = "uber"`.

**Template structure:**

Templates use standardized snake_case fields and handlebars variables (e.g., `{{variable}}`). All channels (email, SMS, WhatsApp, push) follow consistent structures. SuprSend automatically selects the most specific variant based on tenant ID, language, and custom conditions.

**Benefits:**

- **Tenant isolation:** Changes made by Uber won't affect other tenants' templates
- **Platform control:** Your platform maintains template structure and approval workflows
- **Self-service:** Customers can customize content without engineering support

<Tip>
For channels requiring approval (WhatsApp, SMS DLT), templates must be approved before going live. For more details on template embedding, see the [Embeddable Template Editor →](/docs/embeddable-templates) guide.

### 5. Choose Workflow Strategy

Choose between Visual Builder Workflows and Dynamic Workflows based on your needs.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Visual Builder Workflows">
    SuprSend owns orchestration logic. Build workflows visually in the dashboard with drag-and-drop nodes, conditions, and delays.

    **When to use:**
    - Non-engineers need to create or modify workflows
    - Customer admins need visibility into notification flows
    - You want visual workflow management without code changes
    - Product or marketing teams need self-service workflow creation

    **Use cases:**
    - Marketing campaigns that change frequently
    - Onboarding sequences managed by product teams
    - Customer admins customizing their notification flows
    - Workflows that need frequent A/B testing

    <CardGroup cols={2}>
      <Card title="Advantages" icon="check-circle">
        - Visual builder<br/>
        - No code required<br/>
        - Self-service for non-technical teams
      </Card>
      <Card title="Trade-offs" icon="info-circle">
        - Less flexible than code<br/>
        - Dashboard access needed<br/>
        - Limited programmatic control
      </Card>
    </CardGroup>

    📘 [Workflows →](/docs/workflows)
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Dynamic Workflows">
    Your platform owns orchestration. Trigger workflows programmatically from your application when events occur.

    **When to use:**
    - Your platform already controls business logic
    - You need runtime workflow creation
    - Workflows are tightly integrated with your codebase
    - You want full programmatic control

    **Use cases:**
    - Employee onboarding notifications (welcome email, first week check-in, manager introduction)
    - Transactional notifications triggered by user actions
    - Real-time event-driven notifications
    - Complex workflows with custom business logic

    **Required fields in trigger payload:**

    - `tenant_id` — Customer company identifier (required)
    - `recipient` — User identifiers (distinct_id, email, etc.)
    - `workflow` or `template` — Workflow/template identifier
    - `category` — Notification category (e.g., `onboarding.new_hire_welcome`)
    - `data` — Business data (employee_name, start_date, manager_name, etc.)

    **Example payload:**

    ```json
    {
      "tenant_id": "uber",
      "category": "onboarding.new_hire_welcome",
      "recipient": {
        "distinct_id": "employee_123",
        "email": "sarah@uber.com"
      },
      "workflow": "new_hire_onboarding",
      "data": {
        "employee_name": "Sarah Chen",
        "start_date": "2026-01-15",
        "manager_name": "John Doe",
        "department": "Engineering"
      }
    }
    ```

    <CardGroup cols={2}>
      <Card title="Advantages" icon="check-circle">
        - Runtime creation<br/>
        - Faster go-live<br/>
        - Works with existing orchestration<br/>
        - Full programmatic control
      </Card>
      <Card title="Trade-offs" icon="info-circle">
        - No visual builder<br/>
        - Code changes required<br/>
        - Engineering team dependency
      </Card>
    </CardGroup>

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Tip>
Most platforms start with Dynamic Workflows for core transactional notifications and introduce Visual Builder Workflows when non-technical teams need to manage marketing or campaign workflows.
</Tip>

### 6. Configure Tenant Vendors (Optional)

Enterprise customers may require their own SMTP servers for deliverability and compliance. For Uber, configure their SMTP within your email provider and set it as a custom property in the tenant. It can be referred to in the `from_email` in the template. If Uber has its own email provider or SMS provider that it wants to use, add it as a tenant vendor so all notifications route through their infrastructure.

**When to use:**
- Customer requires their own SMTP domain for branding
- Compliance requirements (HIPAA, SOC 2, etc.)
- Deliverability concerns with shared infrastructure
- Customer has existing email infrastructure

<Info>
**Vendor fallback chain:** If Uber's SMTP fails, notifications automatically fall back to: Uber SMTP → Platform default SMTP (fallback)
</Info>

📘 [Tenant Vendors →](/docs/tenant-vendor) | [Vendor Fallback →](/docs/vendor-fallback)

## End-to-End Notification Flow

When WorkVibe triggers a new employee onboarding notification for Uber, SuprSend handles everything automatically:

<Steps>
  <Step title="1. Platform Identifies Tenant">
    WorkVibe passes `tenant_id: "uber"` in the workflow trigger payload. SuprSend uses this to identify which customer company's branding and preferences to apply.
  </Step>
  <Step title="2. Apply Tenant Preferences">
    Checks Uber's defaults for `onboarding.new_hire_welcome`: Email enabled, SMS disabled, Slack enabled.
  </Step>
  <Step title="3. Apply Employee Preferences">
    Employee opts out of Slack → Final channels: Email only.
  </Step>
  <Step title="4. Resolve Template">
    Checks for a tenant-specific variant. Falls back to `NEW_HIRE_WELCOME_EMAIL` with Uber branding.
  </Step>
  <Step title="5. Render Branding">
    Applies Uber's logo, colors, and company name to template.
  </Step>
  <Step title="6. Route via Vendor">
    Routes through Uber's SMTP if configured, otherwise platform default.
  </Step>
  <Step title="7. Deliver">
    Email sent with Uber branding and onboarding details.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Other Common Scenarios

This data modeling approach applies to various multi-tenant marketplaces and platforms:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Travel booking platforms" icon="plane">
    Travelers receive confirmations branded by hotels/airlines, with tenant-specific preferences and vendor routing
  </Card>
  <Card title="Food delivery marketplaces" icon="utensils">
    Customers receive order updates branded by restaurants, each with their own branding and notification preferences
  </Card>
  <Card title="E-commerce marketplaces" icon="shopping-cart">
    Shoppers receive purchase confirmations branded by sellers, with per-seller branding and vendor configuration
  </Card>
  <Card title="Event ticketing platforms" icon="ticket">
    Attendees receive tickets branded by event organizers, with organizer-level preferences and custom SMTP
  </Card>
  <Card title="Learning platforms" icon="graduation-cap">
    Students receive course updates branded by educational institutions, with institution-specific branding and channels
  </Card>
  <Card title="Healthcare scheduling platforms" icon="heart">
    Patients receive appointment reminders branded by clinics, with clinic-level preferences and compliance routing
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
The same principles apply: end users interact with your platform, but notifications must reflect each customer's branding, preferences, and vendor routing.
</Note>

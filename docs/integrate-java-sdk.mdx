## Installation

For SDK installation, you'll have to add the SuprSend jar file. You can include the jar using following two ways:

<Accordion title="Option 1. As a Maven dependency for maven projects from downloaded jar">
  `suprsend-java-sdk` is present as a maven dependency on maven central. Add following code to your pom.xml to include the sdk

  <CodeGroup>

  ```xml xml
  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.suprsend</groupId>
      <artifactId>suprsend-java-sdk</artifactId>
      <version>0.5.0</version>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>
  ```

  </CodeGroup>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Option 2. As a jar file for non maven projects">
  Click [here](https://github.com/suprsend/suprsend-java-sdk/releases/download/v0.5.0/suprsend-java-sdk-0.5.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar) to download the latest version of java SDK from releases section and add it as an External Jar in your build path. suprsend-java-sdk is available as a JAR with name - `suprsend-java-sdk-0.5.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar`

  <Check>
    **JDK version 8 and above is supported**

    Please check your Java development kit version. If it is lower than supported version, upgrade it to the latest version
  </Check>
</Accordion>

## Initialization

For initializing SDK, you need **WORKSPACE KEY** and **WORKSPACE SECRET**.

<CodeGroup>

```java Request
import suprsend.Suprsend;
Suprsend suprsend = new Suprsend("WORKSPACE KEY", "WORKSPACE SECRET");
```

</CodeGroup>

Replace `WORKSPACE KEY` and `WORKSPACE SECRET` with your workspace values. You will get both the tokens from Developers -> API keys section.

## Constructor to test SDK in debug mode

Constructor allows you to view HTTP calls to Suprsend in your console. The final parameter is a boolean parameter which denotes whether value for "debug" is true or false. Default value for the same is false.

<CodeGroup>

```java Request
import suprsend.Suprsend;
Suprsend suprsend = new Suprsend("WORKSPACE KEY", "WORKSPACE SECRET", true);
```

</CodeGroup>

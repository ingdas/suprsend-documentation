## Define stores in SDK

For supporting multiple tabs, list of stores need to be defined while initializing inbox SDK. If stores is ignored you can get all notifications.

## How to configure tags for tabs

To show notifications in tabs based on tags:

1. **Add tags in Inbox template**: Go to your Inbox template → **Advanced configuration** → **Tags** section and add the tag (e.g., `mentions`). After publishing the template, you can click on the tag to copy it.

2. **Configure tags in Inbox config**: In your Inbox configuration, pass the tag in the query as `tags: "mentions"` (or use an array for multiple tags like `tags: ["mentions", "replies"]`).

<Note>
  **Important**: Tags in workflow are used to group or filter similar workflows on the workflow listing page. Tags filter inside Inbox works on the tags provided in the Inbox template, not workflow tags.

  ```javascript Example with tags
  stores = [
    { storeId: "all", label: "All" },
    { storeId: "mentions", label: "Mentions", query: { tags: "mentions" } },
    { storeId: "archived", label: "Archived", query: { archived: true } }
  ]
  ```
  ```javascript Example with multiple filters
  stores = [{ storeId: "testing", label: "Test", query: { categories: "transactional" , read:true, tags:["profile", "user"]} }]
  ```
</CodeGroup>

The first example shows how to create tabs for "All", "Mentions" (filtered by `mentions` tag), and "Archived" notifications. The second example gets notifications which belong to transactional category and in read state and has profile or user tag.

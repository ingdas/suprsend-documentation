## Add Provider Configurations based on Workspaces

You may have different chat provider settings for staging and for production. Hence, we have given an option to add provider settings based on your workspaces. Make sure that you add provider settings for each workspace, else communications will fail to deliver. Read more about Workspaces [here](/docs/workspace).

This guide assumes you have access to AWS console and have necessary permissions. If you don't have an AWS account, then you can [create here](https://aws.amazon.com/resources/create-account/).

## Amazon SES integration on SuprSend account

Follow below steps to integrate your Amazon SES account with SuprSend:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create AWS IAM user" stepNumber="1">
    To send email through SES, you need an IAM user (Access-Key-ID and Secret-Access-Key) with necessary permission. To create an IAM user, refer to this [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html)

    * Create an IAM user (with Programmatic access).

    * Attach Policy`AmazonSESFullAccess `to this user.

    * Copy and save the `Access-key-ID`and`Secret-Access-Key`securely. You'll need to add this information on SuprSend vendor integration page

    An AWS SES resource resides in a particular region. Make a note of which aws-region you are going to use for sending emails. In this guide, we'll assume aws-region :`ap-south-1` for all illustrative purposes.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create SES Verified Identity" stepNumber="2">
    Open AWS SES console. Go to `Verified Identities` tab. You can add an email-address or a domain/subdomain as an identity. Follow this [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/creating-identities.html) to understand what an identity is and how to create and verify one.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Configuration Set" stepNumber="3">
    Configuration-set is a ruleset applied to send-email. In configuration-set you can specify to track events (e.g. send, delivery, open, click, bounce, complaint etc.) and send these to an event destination. Refer to the documentation on how to [create configuration sets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/creating-configuration-sets.html).

    In SES console, go to `Configuration sets`

    1. Click`create set`button to create a new configuration-set

    2. Give it a name (e.g.`ses_suprsend_configset`)

    3. Select your Sending IP-pool (you can leave`default`if you don't have a dedicated-IP-pool).

    4. Click`Create Set`button.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Manange Event destinations" stepNumber="4">
    After creating configuration-set, you'll see a tab "Event Destinations". Email-sending events (send, delivery, open, click, bounce, complaint etc.) will end up in the events destination. Reference documentations:



    * [**Creating Amazon SES event destinations**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/event-destinations-manage.html)

    * [Setup SNS event destination for event Publishing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/event-publishing-add-event-destination-sns.html)



    **Steps to follow for setting up Event Destination and enable Event Tracking:**

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Select the Event Types">
        Go to`Event Destinations`tab and click`Add destination`In "Select event types" step, click`Select all`button to received all the events to destination.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Click on Next.">

      </Step>

      <Step title="Go to &#x22;Specify Destination&#x22;">
        In "`Specify destination`" step.

        1. Select Destination Type:`Amazon SNS`.

        2. Enter a destination Name (e.g`ses_suprsend_configset_destination`)

        3. Make sure`Event publishing`is marked`Enabled`.

        4. Select an SNS topic from the dropdown (or create a new topic) for events destination.

        5. To create a topic, click` Create SNS topic`. In the popup, put `Topic Name` and `Display Name`

        6. Click `Create`.

        7. Now from the dropdown, select the topic you just created.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Click on &#x22;Next&#x22;.">

      </Step>

      <Step title="Verify information">
        In the `Review` step, verify the info.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Click &#x22;Add destination&#x22;.">

      </Step>
    </Steps>

    Now that you've created a configuration-set to send emails and have specified to receive its events to an SNS-topic, next step is to give SuprSend permission to subscribe to this SNS-topic.



    AWS provides functionality where a different AWS account (in this case SuprSend) can subscribe to an SNS-topic in your account. For more details, [checkout here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-send-message-to-sqs-cross-account.html).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Give SuprSend permission to Subscribe to SNS topic." stepNumber="5">
    Go to AWS SNS Console and open Topics list. Click on the topic that you created in the earlier step.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Step 1">
        Click on`Edit`. On the edit page, expand the`Access Policy`section. The policy looks something like below. You'll notice that the current policy gives`sns:Publish`permission to your SES account.

        <CodeGroup>
          ```json Amazon SNS Console
           	 {
          	  "Version": "2008-10-17",
          	  "Statement": [
          	    {
          	      "Sid": "stmt1651045546197",
          	      "Effect": "Allow",
          	      "Principal": {
          	        "Service": "ses.amazonaws.com"
          	      },
          	      "Action": "sns:Publish",
          	      "Resource": "arn:aws:sns:topic_region:111122223333:topic_name",
          	      "Condition": {
          	      	"StringEquals": {
          	          "AWS:SourceAccount": "111122223333"
          	        },
          	        "StringLike": {
          	          "AWS:SourceArn": "arn:aws:ses:*"
          	        }
          	      }
          	    }
          	  ]
          	}
          ```
        </CodeGroup>
      </Step>

      <Step title="Step 2">
        Next you need to add a policy to give`sns:Subscribe`permission to SuprSend (Account: 924219879248). Add below json inside the`Statement`list: (replace the "`Resource`" value with your "Resource" value)

        <CodeGroup>
          ```json Amazon SNS Console
          {
              "Effect":"Allow",
              "Principal":{
                  "AWS":"924219879248"
              },
              "Action":"sns:Subscribe",
              "Resource":"arn:aws:sns:topic_region:111122223333:topic_name"
          }
          ```
        </CodeGroup>
      </Step>

      <Step title="Step 3">
        So in effect, the whole policy would look like:

        <CodeGroup>
          ```json Amazon SNS Console
          	{
          	  "Version": "2008-10-17",
          	  "Statement": [
          	    {
          	      "Sid": "stmt1651045546197",
          	      "Effect": "Allow",
          	      "Principal": {
          	        "Service": "ses.amazonaws.com"
          	      },
          	      "Action": "sns:Publish",
          	      "Resource": "arn:aws:sns:topic_region:111122223333:topic_name",
          	      "Condition": {
          	      	"StringEquals": {
          	          "AWS:SourceAccount": "111122223333"
          	        },
          	        "StringLike": {
          	          "AWS:SourceArn": "arn:aws:ses:*"
          	        }
          	      }
          	    },
          	    {
          		    "Effect":"Allow",
          		    "Principal":{
          		      "AWS":"924219879248"
          		    },
          		    "Action":"sns:Subscribe",
          		    "Resource":"arn:aws:sns:topic_region:111122223333:topic_name"
          		}
          	  ]
          	}
          ```
        </CodeGroup>
      </Step>

      <Step title="ClickSave." />
    </Steps>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Fill Vendor settings page on Suprsend" stepNumber="6">
    On the SuprSend dashboard, follow the steps as below:

    1. Select Vendors from the left panel.

    2. Select 'Email' as the channel from the list.

    3. Select the communication category from the list - System, Transactional, Promotional.

    4. Select 'Amazon SES' from the list Vendors.

## Setting Amazon SES event tracking

One of the platform advantage of using SuprSend as a central communication system is that it shows notification analytics for all channels in your SuprSend account together. For enabling event tracking at SuprSend (such as delivery, opened, blocked, spam etc.), you'll have to `sns:Subscribe`action to SuprSend.

Once you've given `sns:Subscribe` Action permission (to SuprSend AWS Account) on your SNS-topic, suprsend will attempt to create a subscription on that topic. Once subscription succeeds, you should see successfully "Subscribed" to topic when you visit the Vendor settings page. Email Tracking should start working

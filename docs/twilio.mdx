### How to get Messaging service SID from your Twilio account

To send messages through Twilio acccount, we need a Twilio messaging service with phone number attached to it. Twilio Messaging service is a pool of sender phone numbers having the same features and configurations. It helps in 2 major use cases,

1. **Sending to candidate's around different geographical regions**. For example - if you want to send to both US and Indian numbers, you can add one sender number for US and one sender mobile number for India in the same messaging service and twilio will automatically choose the number belonging to the nearest region to send to your end users
2. **Managing the scale of your notifications**. In case of high message volumes, twilio distributes your outbound messaging traffic evenly across the phone numbers in your Messaging Service so that the delivery doesn't get affected

You can refer to Twilio's excellent [documentation on messaging service](https://www.twilio.com/docs/messaging/services) to know more about it

To get a messaging service SID, you'll have to purchase a twilio phone number and add it to a messaging service

### How to purchase a twilio phone number

Navigate to the "[Phone Numbers](https://console.twilio.com/us1/develop/phone-numbers)" page of the Twilio console. Then, click on "**Buy a Number**" from left side *# Phone Numbers* menu.

![](/images/docs/4fbd20c-Screenshot_2022-08-21_at_8.53.14_PM.png)

On "Buy a Number" page:

1. Select the relevant country
2. Check the "SMS" box in capabilities section to filter for numbers with SMS capability
3. Click on "Search". This will load the list of available numbers with SMS capability in your region and the price of each number listed in a table.
4. Select whichever available number appeals to you. Click on "Buy" button next to the mobile number to buy that number.
5. This will open a modal, scroll down and click on "Buy +1 xxx ..." button and then select, "Setup number." This will load a phone number configuration page. We don't need to change anything for this tutorial.

If you are new to Twilio, your trial account is initially funded with enough money to purchase a phone number, so you won't have any expenses while completing this guide.

You may be asked to comply with the regulatory requirements associated with the number — thorough regulatory [documentation](https://www.twilio.com/guidelines/regulatory) is provided by Twilio. Be sure to use your number responsibly and comply with any requirements.

### Twilio messaging service

Now that we have a phone number, we need to create a Twilio Messaging Service that uses this number. Navigate to the "[Messaging -> "Services"](https://console.twilio.com/us1/develop/sms/services?frameUrl=%2Fconsole%2Fsms%2Fservices%3Fx-target-region%3Dus1)" section on [explore products](https://console.twilio.com/develop/explore) page.

On "Messaging Services" page:

1. Click on "Create Messaging Service" button

![](/images/docs/8810e38-Twilio_messaging_service.png)

2. This will open "Messaging Service Setup". Enter the value of two fields: "Friendly Name," and "Use Case".

   1. Let's use "SuprSend SMS service" for "Friendly name"
   2. There are several "Use Case" options. For this tutorial, we can select "Notify my users". Next, click "Create Messaging Service"

![](/images/docs/c482a83-Screenshot_2022-08-21_at_9.30.47_PM.png)

3. The next step is to add the number that we have bought to this messaging service
4. Once the number is added, Click on "Set up integration"

![](https://files.readme.io/d81eb01-twilio_add_number.gif)

5. On "Integration" page, scroll down to add "Callback URL". Add SuprSend webhook URL here to track delivery reports on SuprSend dashboard:
   1. Webhook URL - `https://hub.suprsend.com/webhook/twilio/sms`

![](/images/docs/f2f5f51-Add_callback_URL.png)

6. Then Click on "Complete Messaging Service Setup" to complete the setup
7. Copy the SID value and add it in Twilio Vendor page

## Setting Callback URL in Twilio Account

One of the platform advantage of using SuprSend as a central communication system is that it shows notification analytics for all channels in your SuprSend account together.

By default SuprSend Webhook URL is configured in Twilio. This will help you to track the message delivery status and failure logs on SuprSend dashboard. If you have a requirement where you would want to get the DLR reports in your backend, contact us at [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#72010702021d0006320107020001171c165c111d1f)

<Warning>
  Vendor switching from Twilio to any Indian vendor is currenly not supported due to DLT restrictions. So, if you are using twilio as your default vendor for any of the communication type, you'll not be able to choose a different vendor in other communication type. Though choosing a different vendor in other workspace will still be supported
</Warning>

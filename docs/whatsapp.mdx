This section is a step-by-step guide on how to design and publish Whatsapp notification template.

## Design Template

You can design the template with a simple form editor tool. You can add variables with `Handlebarsjs` language. You can see how the message will look in the preview section on the right side.

Once designed, save the Whatsapp template by clicking on the `Save Draft` button. When you are ready, you can `Publish Draft` by providing a name to the version. This will create a version in `Pending Approval` state.

Whatsapp requires a template approval process, where every template has to be submitted to Whatsapp for approval, where Whatsapp reviews and either Approves or Rejects the message.

SuprSend handles the Whatsapp approval process for you. All you have to do is create a template on SuprSend while following [Whatsapp template guidelines](/docs/whatsapp-template-guidelines), and we'll send an email to you as soon as Whatsapp approves / rejects the template.

Based on the approval status, the published template version's state will move to `Live` or `Rejected`. Once the version goes `Live`, you can use the template to send messages to your users.

## How to format whatsapp messages

WhatsApp allows you to format text inside your messages. Use below options to format the text. **Other formatting like HTML tags or markdown will not work** for formatting the content

| Text Format       | Method           | Description                                                                  |
| ----------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Italic**        | \_text\_         | To *italicize* your message, place an underscore on both sides of the text   |
| **Bold**          | \*text\*         | To **bold** your message, place an asterisk on both sides of the text        |
| **Strikethrough** | \~text\~         | To ~~strikethrough~~ your message, place a tilde on both sides of the text   |
| **Monospace**     | \`\`\`text\`\`\` | To `monospace` your message, place three backticks on both sides of the text |

## Adding Dynamic Content in the template

There will always be the case where you would require to add dynamic content to a template, so as to personalise it for your users. To achieve this, you can add variables in the template, which will be replaced with the dynamic content at the time of sending the message. You'll need to pass these while triggering the communication from one of our frontend or backend SDKs. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to add dynamic content in Inbox:


<Steps>
  <Step title="Declaring Variables in the global 'Mock data' button" icon={1} stepNumber="1">
    If you are at this stage, it is assumed that you have declared the variables along with sample values in the global **Mock data** button. To see how to declare variables before using them in designing templates, refer refer to [this section in the Templates documentation](/docs/templates#adding-dynamic-content).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Using variables in the templates" icon={2} stepNumber="2">
    Once the variables are declared, you can use them while designing the android push template. We support `handlebarsjs` to add variables in the template. As a general rule, all the variables have to be entered within double curly brackets: `{{variable_name}}`



    If you have declared the variables in the global 'Mock data' button, then they will come as auto-suggestions when you type a curly bracket `{`. This will remove the chances of errors like variable mismatch at the time of template rendering.



    Note that you will be able to enter a variable name even when you have not declared it inside the 'Variables' button. To manually enter the variable name, follow the [handlerbarsjs guide here](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/#what-is-handlebars).



    Below is an example of how to enter variables in the template design. For illustration, we are using the same sample variable names that we declared in the 'Templates' section:

    <CodeGroup>
      ```json json
      {
        "array": [
          {
            "product_name": "Aldo Sling Bag",
            "product_price": "$50"
          },
          {
            "product_name": "Clarles & Keith Women Slipper, Biege, 38UK",
            "product_price": "$39"
          },
          {
            "product_name": "RayBan Sunglasses",
            "product_price": "$120"
          }
        ],
        "event": {
          "location": {
            "city": "San Francisco",
            "state": "California"
          },
          "order_id": "11200123",
          "first_name": "Joe"
        },
        "product_page": "https://www.suprsend.com"
      }
      ```
    </CodeGroup>

    1. To enter a nested variable, enter in the format `{{var1.var2.var3}}`. Eg. to refer to city in the example above, you need to enter `{{event.location.city}}`

    2. To refer to an array element, enter in format `{{var1.[_index_].var2}}. Eg. to refer to ` product_name `of the first element of the array` array `, enter ` `\{{array.[0].product_name}}`

    3. If you have any space in the variable name, enclose it in square bracket `{{event.[first name]}}` 
    
    You will be able to see the sample values in the Preview section, as well as in the Live version when you publish a draft. If you cannot see your variable being rendered with the sample value, check one of the following:

    1. Make sure you have entered the variable name and the sample value in the `Variables` button.

    2. Make sure you have entered the correct variable name in the template, as per the `handlebarsjs` guideline.

    <Warning>
      At the time of sending communication, if there is a variable present in the template whose value is not rendered due to mismatch or missing, SuprSend will simply discard the template and not send that particular notification to your user.

      Please note that the rest of the templates will be sent. Eg. if there is an error in rendering Android Push template, but email template is successfully rendered, Android Push notification will not be triggered, but email notification will be triggered by SuprSend.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

title: "SMS Integrations"

SuprSend sends SMS to your users via reputed SMS service providers (called Vendors on SuprSend platform). You need to make an account with atleast **one** of these providers, and provide login credentials of these accounts on SuprSend dashboard. Once this is done, you will be able to send SMS to your users via SuprSend.

All integrations related to sending SMS, collecting responses, and maintenance will be handled by SuprSend. Whenever you would like to add more SMS providers, or switch providers, simply add a new SMS provider on SuprSend dashboard and make it 'Default'; your SMSs will start going from that provider.

SuprSend has done integration with following SMS providers. These SMS providers are chosen carefully on the basis of multiple factors, like IP reputation, shared vs dedicated IP, delivery rate, strength of APIs, real-time monitoring, etc. We will be adding more SMS providers shortly.

## Add SMS Vendors based on Workspaces

You may have different sms vendor accounts for staging and for production. Hence, we have given an option to add SMS vendors based on your workspaces. Make sure that you add vendor details for each workspace, else communications will fail to deliver. Read more about Workspaces [here](/docs/workspace).

## Add SMS Vendors based on Communication Category

We have given an option to add SMS vendors based on communication category. At SuprSend, we have defined 3 types of communication categories for SMS: OTP, Transactional (*Both Service Explicit and Service Implicit messages fall in this category*) and Promotional

You can add different vendors for these categories, or have different accounts from the same vendor, depending on your need.

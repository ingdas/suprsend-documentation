You can use multi-channel delivery node to notify users on multiple channels at once. If you want to send multi-channel notifications, we recommend using [smart channel routing](/docs/smart-delivery) to ensure that notifications are delivered sequentially on multiple channels rather than bombarding users on all channels at once.

The content of the notification is designed with [templates](/docs/templates). In SuprSend, you can design the content of multiple channels within a single template group.

## How the delivery node is executed?

Delivery node is successfully executed if all of the below checks hold true:

1. The channel should be published and live in the template. For WhatsApp and SMS (Indian vendors), templates become live upon approval by the respective provider.
2. Vendor Configuration is available for the channel. For all out-of-app channels, you need to create an account with the respective [channel provider](/docs/vendors) and add the configuration in the vendor form on SuprSend dashboard. Inbox is an internal offering by SuprSend and doesn't need any third party integration. [Refer Integration guide](/docs/inbox-overview) to setup Inbox Channel.
3. Channel information should be available in user profile and channel status should be active. Template channels not available in user profile are skipped for delivery. A set channel becomes inactive in case the channel is`removed `or `unset`using [SDK or API](/docs/users#via-sdk) or it is marked inactive by SuprSend.
4. User preference is`opt-in `for the given channel and notification category (defined in workflow settings). You can check user preference status using [get user preference API](/reference/get-user-preferences-single-category).

  ### Inactive Channel Marking by SuprSend

  SuprSend marks the user channel identity inactive for email and whatsapp in case of hard errors from vendor end, such as bounced email addresses, unregistered whatsapp numbers.

  This is done to safeguard your email domain authority or whatsapp rating if you continue to send notifications to users who have reported or marked your email or messages as spam.

  Additionally, this helps in whatsapp cost saving, as vendor charges for every processed request. Inactive marking period by SuprSend is 15 days for whatsapp and 90 days for email.

## Selecting channels for multi-channel delivery

By default, notification is sent on all active channels of the template. You can however choose to send notification on selected channels by manually choosing selected channels in the form or [override channels](/docs/delivery-multi-channel#override-channels) dynamically using data in your event property.

### Override Channels

You can use this field to pass channel list dynamically using data in your event property. This feature comes in handy when user channels are dynamically defined at the user level for each workflow. For instance, when booking an appointment, your users are dynamically defining their preferred channel to receive booking updates for each appointment.

For more consistent channel preferences, like user wanting to receive all communication via email only, or defining preferred communication channel for a notifications category (like booking updates), we recommend updating it using [user preferences](/docs/preferences).

To override channels, include the channels array in event property and add the corresponding key in the override channels field on SuprSend workflow form.

The expected channel values are: `\\\["email", "sms", "whatsapp", "androidpush", "iospush", "webpush", "slack", "inbox", "ms_teams"\\\]`

You can add channel array as a [JQ-expression](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/manual/). So, in case your channel values do not match with the one mentioned in the above table, you can transform it using the JQ-expression. Below are some examples of how to add duration key in JQ format:

1. General format for duration key at parent level is`.channels`
2. If channel is a nested event property key like shown below, enter it in the format`.user.channels`.

<CodeGroup>

```json Trigger Payload
properties = {													  
  "user": {
    "name": "Steve",
    "channels": ["email","inbox]
  }
```

</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
  - If both selected channels and override channels key are set in the form, system will prioritize the override channels, even if that channel is not included in the selected channel list.
  - When the override channel variable in the event data is missing, or resolves to an invalid value, workflow execution will stop and corresponding error will be logged in the logs
</Warning>

## Success Metric

Success metric can be any event which defines the target user activity you aim to drive with your sent notification. For example, if the objective of your notification is to prompt users to open it, such as in the case of newsletters, you can set your success metric as `Notification Status - Seen`. If your goal is for users to perform any custom event, like complete payment in case of payment reminder notification, then you can set that event as your success metric.

In the context of multi-channel delivery, the success metric is utilized solely to track conversion numbers for display in workflow analytics. However, in the case of [smart channel routing](/docs/smart-delivery), the same success metric serves to halt delivery on further channels once the success metric is achieved.

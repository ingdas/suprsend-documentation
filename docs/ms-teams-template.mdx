## Step 1: Design Template

You can design a simple text template with our default markdown editor. For advanced formatting and interactive options like buttons, images, and avatars, you can use microsoft's [adaptive card design](https://adaptivecards.io/designer/) in JSONNET editor. Please note that the variable format for both editors will be different. We'll cover more about it in the next sections.

### Design simple text template using Markdown editor

You can send simple text templates using the markdown editor in teams. Variables has to be added in handlebars format. Supported markdown syntaxes in Teams text messages:

| Format            | Syntax                                                                                                           |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Headings          | `# Heading level 1`. Refer all [heading formats](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#headings) here      |
| line break        | end a line with two or more spaces, and then type return (*only 1 continuous line break is supported*)           |
| **Bold**          | `**bold text**` or `__bold text__`                                                                               |
| *Italic*          | `_italic text_` or `*italic text*`                                                                               |
| ***Bold Italic*** | `***bold italic text***` or `___bold italic text___`                                                             |
| > Blockquotes     | `> block quote text`                                                                                             |
| Lists             | 1. First item 2. Second item Refer more [lists format here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#lists-1) |
| `code`            | `At the command prompt, type `code`.`                                                                            |
| Links             | `[Duck Duck Go](https://duckduckgo.com)`                                                                         |

### Adding dynamic data in markdown editor

We use **`handlebarsjs`** as the template variable language in the markdown editor. You can learn about **`handlebarsjs`** [here.](/docs/handlebars-helpers) If you are new to templates, we would recommend reading the [templates documentation](/docs/templates) first to understand the basics of templating with SuprSend.

To add dynamic data, first add the variable data from your event and workflow request in the **mock data**.

![](/images/docs/a647239-image.png) Enter the variables in \`JSON\` format as shown in the screenshot below. This JSON should be the same as passed in your workflow or event request (it is a part of the \`data\` field for workflow and \`properties\` field for event). ![](/images/docs/d055e38-image.png)

Now, you can use your added sample by adding variables in the template. Type `{{` and you'll start getting auto-suggestions of the variables added in your sample data below the text field. You can select the variable from the dropdown or directly type it in.

As a general rule, all the variables have to be entered within double curly brackets: **`{{variable_name}}`**. For URLs and links, we recommend using triple curly brace&#x73;**`{{{url}}}`**.This is to avoid escaping html entities in handlebars. You can also write transformations like date-time formatting, if-else statement inside your templates using [handlebar helpers](/docs/handlebars-helpers).

### Design adaptive card template using JSONNET editor

You can switch to JSONNET editor for advanced formatting and interactive options like buttons, images, and avatars. Microsoft provides support for [adaptive card design](https://adaptivecards.io/designer/) to design such templates using a drag-and-drop editor. You can design your template in the adaptive card designer and copy the JSON payload from your designer into the Teams JSONNET editor.

We have also created some sample templates for a quick start. You can choose one of the samples from the right side options on top of the editor to start editing. We have used some mock data in our examples. Copy-paste the mock data values in the global "Mock data" button to see the preview.

<Warning>
  Please note that the variable format `${variable}` used in adaptive card is not supported in the JSONNET editor. You'll have to add the variable in JSONNET format as `data.variable`
</Warning>

### Adding dynamic data in JSONNET editor

To add dynamic data, first add the variable data from your event and workflow request in the **mock data**.

![](/images/docs/a647239-image.png) Enter the variables in \`JSON\` format as shown in the screenshot below. This JSON should be the same as passed in your workflow or event request (it is a part of the \`data\` field for workflow and \`properties\` field for event). ![](/images/docs/6081f15-image.png)

Once the variables are declared, you can add them in the template as **`data.<variable_name>`**.

<Info>
  Note that you will be able to enter a variable name even when you have not declared it inside the 'Mock data' button. However, the preview will not load without declaring the variables in "Mock data". Hence it's advised to always declare variables before loading the preview of the template.
</Info>

Below are some examples of how to enter variables in the JSONNET editor. We'll use the sample shown in the screenshot above as a reference point.

#### 1. Add nested variable

To enter a nested variable, enter in the format `data.var1.var2.var3`. Eg. to refer to city in the example above, you need to enter `data.location.city`

#### 2. Add Variable with space and special characters in variable name

If you have any space in the variable name, enclose it in square bracket `data.event['first name']` or `data[$brand].brand_name`

#### 3. Add Single array element

To refer to an array element, enter in format `data.var[*index*].var2}}`. Eg. to refer to `product_name` of the first element of the array `array`, enter `data.array[0].product_name}}`

#### 4. Add list of array items

Enter in the below format to add a dynamic list of items. In the above example, variable `array` has a list of product items, with `product_name`, and `product_price` as array properties. Below is an example code to fetch array items in a text field list:

<CodeGroup>
  ```json JSONNET
  {
    "$schema": "http://adaptivecards.io/schemas/adaptive-card.json",
    "body": [
      {
        "text": product.name +" at "+ product.price,
        "type": "TextBlock",
        "wrap": true
      }
      for product in data.products
    ],
    "type": "AdaptiveCard",
    "version": "1.6"
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
  You'll need to add mock data for the variables added in your JSONNET template to view the parsed JSON template. JSON template will throw an error in case of missing mock data for a variable
</Warning>

## Step 2: Preview Message

Click on the "Load Preview" button to load the message preview.

> You will be able to see if your template is rendering properly with the sample mock data by loading the preview of your draft version. Make sure to see the preview before publishing the template to check if the parsed JSON is valid or not.

![](/images/docs/c7b68e6-image.png)

## Step 3. Publish the template

Once finalized, you can publish the template by clicking on **"Publish template"** button on the draft version.

![](/images/docs/4314582-image.png)

Your template is now ready to be triggered.

<Warning>
  At the time of sending communication, if there is a variable present in the template whose value is not rendered due to mismatch or missing, SuprSend will simply discard the template and not send that particular notification to your user.

  Please note that the rest of the templates will still be sent. Eg. if there is an error in rendering Teams template, but email template is successfully rendered, Teams notification will not be triggered, but email notification will be triggered by SuprSend.
</Warning>

## How to add Unsubscription link in email

It is advisable to give your recipients the ability to unsubscribe from emails. First, it is required by the [CAN-Spam Act](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/can-spam-act-compliance-guide-business). Second, if you don’t give them this option, they are more likely to click on the spam complaint button, which will cause more harm than allowing them to unsubscribe. Finally, many ESPs look for unsubscribe links and are more likely to filter your email if they don’t have them.

To add "Unsubscribe" link in your email, refer to the section: [Unsubscribe via Subscription Tracking](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/subscription-tracking#how-do-i-just-add-an-unsubscribe-link)

Notification Categories are the category your workflow belongs to. It is used for following purposes:

* **Defining notification latency**: We maintain separate notification queues for different notification category to ensure that marketing and promotional notifications doesn't delay system or time-sensitive notifications.

* [Setting category-level preferences](/docs/user-preferences) **per-user and tenant**: You can create sub-categories for different type of notifications and give your users option to set their notification preferences at category level.

* **Setting category-level rules or limits**: e.g., you can set a rule that all notifications in promotional category should only be sent between 10 AM - 5 PM or the max notifications in the category should not exceed 100k per day.

## Top-level categories

SuprSend has 3 broad notification categories - **System** , **Transactional** and **Promotional**. Notifications rules and latency settings are defined at these top level categories. You can create further [sub-categories](docs/notification-category#creating-sub-categories-for-preference-management) in each of these categories to power [user preferences](/docs/user-preferences).

### System

- System notifications are the ones that are essential for your users to use your website and can't be unsubscribed by the users. 
- These notifications are considered most time-sensitive and given the highest priority in notification send queues. 
- Some examples are - OTP, Forgot Password and Verification emails.

### Transactional

- Transactional notifications are the ones that are sent in response to some user transaction or action on your platform. 
- These notifications are considered second in priority in notification queues after system notifications.
- Some examples are - Delivery updates, Payment Confirmation, booking confirmation, Post shared / liked, Balance alerts, account update alert, and reminders.

### Promotional

- Promotional notifications are the ones that are sent out to users to increase sales, promote products, or bring users back to your platform without user doing any interaction in the first place. 
- These communications are generally sent in bulk, consuming a significant portion of the communication pipeline. That's why they are given the least priority in notification queue. 
- You should always send your bulk messages and broadcasts in promotional category so that it doesn't impact the latency of your system and transactional notifications.
- Some examples are: Newsletters, announcements, product updates, upcoming sale or event, deals and discounts, or price drop alerts.

## Creating notification categories for preference management

You can create notification categories from [Developers -> Notification categories](https://app.suprsend.com/en/staging/developers/preference-categories) page. All sub-categories are created in the 3 [top level categories](/docs/notification-category#top-level-categories) mentioned above. Notification rules and latency priority are inherited from the top level category. [Preference](/docs/user-preferences) settings are defined at each sub-category level. Top level categories are not shown on the preference page.

Every category can have sections and sub-categories. User preferences are controlled at the sub-category level.

* **Sub-category** is what end users will see on their preference page.

* **Sections** are used to group related sub-categories on the preference page, facilitating easier navigation and organization on the preference page.

For instance, in the below example, `Quote Approval` and `Forecast` are sub-categories and `Quotes` is the section in which these sub-categories are grouped.

### Creating section

You can update section in any category by clicking on the `+Section` button in each category

![](/images/docs/7c1bb84-small-edit_section.png)

Add name and description for the category and `Save Changes`. You'll see the updated section inside the category and edit it later by clicking on the `Edit` button against that section.

### Adding sub-category
You can add sub-category by clicking on the `+Sub-Category` button in that category. Add relevant information and save changes to create the sub-category.

![](/images/sub-category-optin.png)

You'll need to add name, section and description for the sub-category.
- **Name** automatically generates the slug. So, make sure to not change sub-category name once you have configured it in your workflows or if it is absolutely necessary to change the name, change it in all backend and front workflows otherwise the workflows will start failing.
- **Description** is optional and is shown on the user preference page. It helps user understand what notifications go in this sub-category.
- **Section** is used to group related sub-categories on the preference page for users.

Next, you can set the default preference for the sub-category.

#### Default Preference
You can set following default preferences at category level:

1. **On**: Users will receive notifications in this category by default. You can configure **Opt-in Channels** to specify which channels are included in the default "On" state:
   - **All**: All available channels are enabled by default
   - **Selected Channels only**: Only specific channels you select are enabled by default (e.g., Email, Android Push, iOS Push, In-App Inbox, MS Teams, Slack)
2. **Off**: Users will not receive notifications unless they change the preference
3. **Can't Unsubscribe**: Prevents users from fully opting out of the category. When selected, you can configure:
   - **Mandatory Channels**: Channels which can't be opted out of by the user. Set to "All" or "Selected Channels".
   - **Opt-in Channels**: In case of "Selected" Mandatory Channels, you can configure the channels that will be opted in by default. Channels other than mandatory and opt-in will be skipped for sending notification unless user explicitly opts in to them.

This configuration gives you fine-grained control over which channels a user is opted into by default, letting you differentiate between must-deliver channels, default-on channels, and optional channels.

#### Per-tenant default preference
Tenants can override this [default preference settings](/reference/update-tenant-default-preference) for their end users and hide the categories which are not applicable to their end user. This gives tenants control to choose which notifications are sent to their users or shown to their users for setting preferences.
<br/>
**Default Preferences based on category**<br/>
We recommend the following default preferences for the sub-categories:

* **System**: The default preference is `Can’t Unsubscribe`. We recommend setting the channel most users have on as a mandatory channel so they don’t miss critical notifications even if they opt out of all channels.

* **Transactional**: The default preference is `Can’t Unsubscribe` as these are user-initiated notifications. That said, you’re free to adjust the default preference for this category based on your requirements.

* **Promotional**: The default preference is `ON`, meaning users will receive notifications in this category by default. For categories that are optional, we recommend setting the default to `OFF` so users only receive those notifications if they explicitly opt in.


<Warning>
  **Avoid Changing sub-category name:**
  Changing category name updates the category slug. So, make sure to not change sub-category name once you have configured it in your workflows or if it is absolutely necessary to change the name, change it in all backend and front workflows otherwise the workflows will start failing.
</Warning>

#### Tags
Tags is used to group or filter categories on users' preference page. Tag can also be added at section level. Tags assigned at section level automatically applies to all categories under that section—so filtering by a section tag also filters its child categories.
![Tags Within Preference Categories](/images/preference-tag-changelog.png)

You can filter categories using the tags query parameter in the [get user preference API](/reference/get-user-full-preference).

### Preview changes

Click on **Preview** to see a reference view of ready-made preference center for your end user. Please note that this view is just for reference of how the categories and sections will be placed in end user's view. Actual view will be based on the preference page design in your application.

### Publish changes

All the changes done are saved in draft version. You can publish the changes to make it live for your end users. You'll be able to add the updated categories in workflow call only after publishing the changes.

Click on `Publish Changes` button to publish the changes.

### Clone categories to production workspace

You can test preferences in your staging application and use `Clone` button to clone the changes to production workspace.

## Triggering notification for a sub-category

You can add the sub-category slug in `notification_category` field in your backend workflow call or select the category from dropdown in workflows created through SuprSend dashboard.

You can copy sub-category slug by clicking on sub-category name on the category settings page

<Warning>
  **End of Support for @suprsend/react-preferences-headless: Migrate to @suprsend/react**
</Warning>

- **Older Version** (@suprsend/react-preferences-headless): Development of the `@suprsend/react-preferences-headless` SDK has been discontinued in favour of the new `@suprsend/react` SDK. The whole structure of preferences have been changed from SDK side. Please upgrade to newer version. Refer older version documentation [here](https://docs.suprsend.com/v1.2.1/docs/react-headless).
- **New Version** ([@suprsend/react](https://docs.suprsend.com/docs/preferences-1)): In new version we have added preferences in our core react SDK to bring all SuprSend features under one SDK along with few minor changes.

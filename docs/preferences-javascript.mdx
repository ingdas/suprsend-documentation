- **Older Version** (`@suprsend/web-sdk@<=2.0.0`): In `@suprsend/web-sdk@2.0.0` we have revamped SDK to support JWT based authentication along with few structural changes so please upgrade to newer version. Refer older version documentation [here](https://docs.suprsend.com/v1.2.1/docs/preferences-javascript).
- **New Version** ([@suprsend/web-sdk@>=2.0.0](https://docs.suprsend.com/docs/js-preferences)): In new version of web-sdk, JWT based authentication has been implemented which provides better security compared to workspace_key and secret authentication. Along with these, few changes haven been made in terms of preferences method names (added camel casing) and return response structures (return responses inside body key).

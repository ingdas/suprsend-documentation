## Configure Callback URL for delivery status & incoming messages tracking

One of the platform advantage of using SuprSend as a central communication system is that it shows notification analytics for all channels in your SuprSend account together.

After saving the vendor configuration, SuprSend will generate 2 callback URL's: one to track delivery status updates of messages and another to track incoming messages.

Copy the delivery report URLfrom SuprSend and configure it on netcore (**General settings -> event webhook**) Copy the inbound URL from SuprSend and configure it on netcore (**General Settings -> Incoming Webhook**)

## Must know:

1. Netcore DOES NOT support variables in header text (for now), please take care of this point while creating templates on SuprSend and on Netcore.

2. Netcore does not have template auto-approval process, hence, the templates need to be created both on SuprSend and on [Netcore platform](https://cpaas.netcorecloud.com/app/settings/template).

3. There can be slight delay in receiving incoming messages and delivery status update webhook response from Netcore.

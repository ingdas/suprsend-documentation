In this section, we'll cover how to send events to the Suprsend platform for both iOS and Android application

## Pre-requisites

1. [Integrate Flutter SDK in android application](/docs/integrate-flutter-sdk-android)
2. [Integrate Flutter SDK in iOS application](/docs/integrate-flutter-sdk-ios)
3. [Create User Profile](/docs/flutter-create-user)
4. [Create Template on SuprSend platform](/docs/templates) - if you want to trigger workflow by passing the event
5. [Create Workflow on SuprSend Platform](/docs/design-workflow) - if you want to trigger workflow by passing the event

## Create Workflow on SuprSend Platform

For Event based workflow trigger, you'll have to [create the workflow on SuprSend Platform](/docs/design-workflow).

![577](/images/docs/d95d579-Frame_2.png "Frame 2.png")

## Sending Events to SuprSend

Once the workflow is configured, you can pass the `Event Name` ( `GROCERY_PURCHASED` in above example) defined in workflow configuration from your SDK and the related workflow will be triggered. Variables added in the template should be passed as event `properties`

You can send Events from your app to SuprSend platform by using `suprsend.track()` method

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript Dart
  //method
  suprsend.track(event_name); //for single event

  suprsend.track(event_name, property_obj); //for event with properties

  //Sample to track an event
  suprsend.track("clicked");

  //Sample to track an event with one or more properties
  suprsend.track("clicked", {"page":"Dashboard","city":"Bangalore"});
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
  When you create an Event or a property, please ensure that the Event Name or Property Name does not start with **`$`** or **`ss_`**, as we have reserved these symbols for our internal events and property names.
</Warning>

### System Events tracked by SuprSend

There are some system events tracked by SuprSend SDK by default. These are some basic events, as well as events that are necessary for tracking notifications related activity (like delivered, clicked, etc). You are not required to do anything here.

| Event Name               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

## Advanced Concepts

### 1. Super Properties

Super properties are data that are always sent with events data. These super properties will be sent in each event after calling this method. Super properties will be stored in local storage, and will persist across invocations of app.

#### Set Super Property

There are some super properties that SuprSend SDK will send by default. Developer can set custom super properties as well with `suprsend.setSuperProperties()` method

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript Dart
  suprsend.setSuperProperties(property_obj);

  //setting single super property
  suprsend.setSuperProperties({"Location": "San Francisco, CA"}); 

  // setting multiple super properties
  suprsend.setSuperProperties({"Location": "San Francisco, CA","Zipcode": 940167});
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Default Super properties tracked by SuprSend SDK:

| Super Property        | Description                                  | Sample Value     |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| $app\_version\_string | Version of your app                          | 0.0.1            |
| $app\_build\_number   | Build number of your app                     | 2                |
| $os                   | Operating system of the user                 | android          |
| $manufacturer         | Manufacturer of the user's device            | OnePlus          |
| $brand                | Brand of the user's device                   | OnePlus          |
| $model                | Model of the user's device                   | GM1901           |
| $deviceId             | Device id                                    | 89eead05a0150146 |
| $ss\_sdk\_version     | SuprSend SDK version                         | 0.1.31           |
| $network              | Network on which the user is                 | wifi             |
| $connected            | Whether the user is connected to the network | true             |

#### Unset Super Property

There are unset custom super properties with `suprsend.unSetSuperProperty()` method. This method will stop calling that property with every event trigger.

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript Dart
  suprsend.unSetSuperProperty(key);

  //unsetting single super property
  suprsend.unSetSuperProperty({"Location"}); 

  // unsetting multiple super properties
  suprsend.unSetSuperProperty({"Location","Pincode"});
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### 2. Flush Events

SuprSend SDK automatically flushes events at an interval of 5 seconds, and on certain activities like app relaunch, etc. If you wish to flush a time sensitive event to SuprSend immediately, you can use the `suprsend.flush()` method.

All the system tracked events are flushed immediately

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript Dart
  suprsend.flush();
  ```
</CodeGroup>

title: "Email Integrations"

SuprSend sends email to your users via reputed email service providers (called Vendors on SuprSend platform). You need to make an account with at least **one** of these providers, and provide API key of these accounts on SuprSend dashboard. Once this is done, you will be able to send email to your users via SuprSend.

All integrations related to sending email, collecting responses, and maintenance will be handled by SuprSend. Whenever you would like to add more email providers, or switch providers, simply add a new email provider on SuprSend dashboard and make it 'Default'; your emails will start going from that provider.

SuprSend has done integration with following email providers. These email providers are chosen carefully on the basis of multiple factors, like IP reputation, shared vs dedicated IP, delivery rate, strength of APIs, real-time monitoring, etc. We will be adding more email providers shortly.

## Add Email Vendors based on Workspaces

You may have different email vendor accounts for staging and for production. Hence, we have given an option to add email vendors based on your workspaces. Make sure that you add vendor details for each workspace, else communications will fail to deliver. 

## Add Email Vendors based on Communication Category

We have given an option to add email vendors based on communication category. At SuprSend, we have defined 3 types of communication categories: System, Transactional and Promotional. You can read more about these categories [here](/docs/notification-category).

You can add different vendors for these categories, or have different accounts from the same vendor, depending on your need.

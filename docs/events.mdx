The event (or sometimes referred to as event_name) is a string describing an event. Events are also used to trigger [workflows designed on SuprSend Platform](/docs/trigger-workflow). All you have to do is send the event to SuprSend platform and the associated workflows will be triggered

Below is an example of workflow with **'Event Name'** (`GROCERY_PURCHASED`) defined as trigger

## Send Event to SuprSend

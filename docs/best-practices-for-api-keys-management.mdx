title: "Best Practices for Key & Token Management"
description: "How to securely manage Workspace Keys, Secrets, API Keys, and Service Tokens in your application and backend code."
---

SuprSend provides multiple authentication methods, each with different scopes:  

- **Workspace Key & Secret** → Backend SDK authentication  
- **API Keys** → REST API authentication per workspace  
- **Service Tokens** → Management API authentication across workspaces  

This guide covers best practices for keeping them secure.

## 1. Workspace Key & Secret  

- Pre-generated for each workspace.  
- Used only with **backend SDKs**.  
- Safer by design as the **Workspace Secret is never transmitted over the network**.  

**Best Practices**:  
- Never share Workspace Secrets (not even with SuprSend support).  
- Store them securely in environment variables or a key management system.  
- Rotate if compromised or leaked. Secret rotation option is not currently exposed to SuprSend dashboard. Please reach out to [support@suprsend.com](mailto:support@suprsend.com) for secret rotation.

## 2. API Keys  

- Used for authenticating **REST API requests** at the workspace level.  
- Each workspace has its own set of API Keys, isolating staging and production environments.  

**Best Practices**:  
- Treat API Keys as sensitive secrets — never expose them in client-side code.  
- Always store keys securely (as environment variables or in a secure vault).  
- Rotate periodically (e.g., every 6 months).  
- Rotate immediately if a key is compromised or accidentally exposed.  
- Monitor API usage for anomalies on [SuprSend dashboard -> Logs (Requests tab)](https://app.suprsend.com/en/staging/logs/requests?last_n_minutes=1440) (unexpected spikes, unauthorized calls).

## 3. Service Tokens  

- Used to authenticate **Management APIs**.  
- Scoped at the **account level**, allowing cross-workspace operations (e.g., promoting workflows from staging → production).  
- Provide higher privilege than API Keys, so require stricter handling.  

**Best Practices**:  
- Limit use of Service Tokens to CI/CD pipelines and automation — avoid day-to-day manual use.  
- Store them as environment variable or encrypted secrets manager.  
- Rotate on a scheduled basis (every 6–12 months).  
- Rotate immediately if exposed or if a privileged user leaves the team.  
- Maintain strict access control — only admins or automation systems should have access.

## General Security Guidelines  

1. **Never commit keys/tokens** to version control (e.g., GitHub).  
2. **Use environment variables** or a **Key Management Service** (e.g., AWS KMS, HCP Vault, GCP Secret Manager).  
3. **Follow least privilege principle** — share keys only with systems or people that need them.  
4. **Set up monitoring & alerts** for unauthorized or unusual activity.  
5. **Rotate keys/tokens** regularly and immediately upon suspected compromise.

## Rotation Strategy  

- **Scheduled Rotation**  
  - API Keys → every 6 months  
  - Service Tokens → every 6–12 months  
  - Workspace Secrets → rotate if organizational policy requires  

- **Ad-Hoc Rotation**  
  - Immediately upon exposure (logs, repositories, screenshots)  
  - On suspicious activity or abuse  
  - When a team member with access leaves

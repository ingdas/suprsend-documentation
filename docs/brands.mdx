If you handle communications to end users on behalf of your customers, you might be tasked with handling custom styling in the messages. This can be quite cumbersome if you have to maintain these customisation for every brand in your codebase.

Brands empower you to send personalized communication on behalf of your customers using a single API. You just have to store brand guidelines like logo, name, colors, social links and other custom properties for your customers once and then use your brand variables in templates to dynamically render the template for each of your customer.

You can programatically create / update brand tenant using either one of our backend SDKs ([Python](/docs/brands-python), [Node](/docs/node-brands), [Java](/docs/brands-java), [Go](/docs/brands-api-go)) or through SuprSend dashboard. We'll cover the method to create brand using SuprSend dashboard.

## Creating / Updating Brand on SuprSend Platform

Go to Brands page from Side Navigation panel. On the brands page, you'll see a default brand created. For every organization, we create a default brand which represents org level settings like org logo, colors, social links etc.

You can create a new brand by clicking on "New Brand" button.

This will open a form to add "**brand id**" and "**brand name**". Add the required fields and click on **"Create brand"**

**Brand id** is a unique identifier for your brand and can't be changed once the brand is created. You'll have to pass brand\_id in your workflow / event calls to render brand level customization in your templates. (if no brand\_id is passed, default brand properties are picked). So, add a brand id which is unique and easily identifiable for you.

**Brand name** can be your customer company / organization name

This will open brand details page. Fill brand details and Save changes. You can always come back and edit it again later

## Using brand components in templates

### 1. Ready-to-use brand components in email

You can use brand component in email to add ready-to-use header, footer and buttons in your email template. Brand component automatically uses brand logo, social links and primary color to style the email template. You'll find the brand component in right side content menu in email editor.

![](/images/docs/2b5cba1-image.png)

You can add brand component and change block type to switch between header, footer and buttons

![](/images/docs/9bb5a1b-image.png)

You can change the component using standard customization options like padding, background color etc. to best suit your email template.

### 2. Use brand variable for all channels

You can add brand variables in all channel templates as `$brand.<property>`. For example, if you have to add brand\_name in your template, you can add it as `$brand.brand_name`. Also, when you type `{`, brand variable will automatically come up in auto-suggestions for your to add in the template

![](/images/docs/9d494a1-small-Screenshot_2023-05-09_at_10.17.27_PM.png)

## Triggering notification for your brand

After adding the brand variables in your template, you can add brand\_id in your workflow or event trigger to trigger notification for that brand. This will replace brand variables with the properties of that brand at run time.

### 1. Adding brand\_id in workflow trigger

<CodeGroup>
  ```python python
  from suprsend import Workflow

  # Prepare Workflow body
  workflow_body = {...}   

  # Add brand_id in workflow instance
  wf = Workflow(body=workflow_body, brand_id='_brand_id')

  # Trigger workflow
  response = supr_client.trigger_workflow(wf)
  print(response)
  ```

  ```javascript Node
  const { Workflow } = require("@suprsend/node-sdk")

  // Prepare Workflow body
  const workflow_body = {...}
                         
  // Add brand_id in workflow instance
  const wf = new Workflow(workflow_body, {brand_id: "_brand_id_"})

  // Trigger workflow
  const response =  supr_client.trigger_workflow(wf) // returns promise
  response.then((res) => console.log("response", res));
  ```

  ```go go
  // Create workflow body
  wfBody := map[string]interface{}{...}

  wf := &suprsend.Workflow{
    Body:           wfBody,
    BrandId:        "_brand_id_",
  }

  // Call TriggerWorkflow to send request to Suprsend
  _, err = suprClient.TriggerWorkflow(wf)
  if err != nil {
    log.Fatalln(err)
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### 2. Adding brand\_id in event trigger

<CodeGroup>
  ```python python
  from suprsend import Event

  distinct_id = "distinct_id" # Mandatory, Unique id of user in your application
  event_name = "event_name"   # Mandatory, name of the event you're tracking

  # Properties:  Optional, default=None, a dict representing event-attributes
  properties = {													
    "key1":"value1",
    "key2":"value2"
  } 

  # Add brand_id in event instance
  event = Event(distinct_id=distinct_id, event_name=event_name, properties=properties, brand_id='_brand_id_')

  # Track event
  response = supr_client.track_event(event)
  print(response)
  ```

  ```javascript Node
  const { Event } = require("@suprsend/node-sdk");

  const distinct_id = "distinct_id" // Mandatory, Unique id of user in your application
  const event_name = "event_name"   // Mandatory, name of the event you're tracking

  // Properties:  Optional, a dict representing event-attributes
  const properties = {													
    "key1":"value1",
    "key2":"value2"
  }  

  // Add brand_id in event instance
  const event = new Event(distinct_id, event_name, properties, {brand_id: "_brand_id_"})

  // Track event
  const response  = supr_client.track_event(event)
  response.then((res) => console.log("response", res));
  ```

  ```go go
  // Add brand_id in event instance
  ev := &suprsend.Event{
    EventName:  "product_purchased", // Mandatory, name of the event you're tracking
    DistinctId: "0fxxx8f74-xxxx-41c5-8752-xxxcb6911fb08", // Mandatory, Unique id of user in your application
    Properties: map[string]interface{}{...},
    BrandId:        "_brand_id_",
    }

    
    // Send event to Suprsend by calling .TrackEvent
    _, err = suprClient.TrackEvent(ev)
    if err != nil {
      log.Fatalln(err)
    }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Possible customizations at brand level

* **Custom Template Designs for Each Brand** - You can create unique template designs for each brand using brand-specific properties. Refer to the [above section](/docs/brands#using-brand-components-in-templates) for details on how to implement this.
* **Route Brand messages from their own vendors** - You can direct messages through a brand's designated vendors by configuring [tenant vendors](/docs/tenant-vendor) on the vendor settings page. Messages will be sent via the vendor associated with the brand\_id provided in the trigger. If no tenant vendor is set, the system will use the default vendor settings.
* **Tenant level preference setting**: Tenants can control what notifications should be sent to their associated users and the their default preference setting. It can be used for cases where admin wants to control the notifications that their teammates receive or when you are sending notifications to multiple tenant's users and tenant wants to control the notifications their users receive, on which channels and at what frequency. [Read more about tenant preferences here](/docs/brand-preference).

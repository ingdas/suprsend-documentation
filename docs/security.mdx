### Data Security

* **Production Databases Access Restriction:**

   Access to production databases is highly restricted, limited to authorized personnel only.

* **Multi-factor Authentication:**

   All Staff members with access to critical systems use secure login mechanisms, including multi-factor authentication.

* **Third-Party Assessments:**

   We have thorough third-party penetration tests and infrastructure audits regularly.

* **Data Encryption:**

   Customer data in production databases and critical endpoints are encrypted to protect against unauthorized access.

* **Data Backups:**

   Regular backups are performed to meet recovery objectives, and the integrity of these backups is periodically tested.

* **Server Logs Retention Policy:**

   Server logs are retained for a maximum of 6 months, after which they are securely and permanently deleted.

* **Automatic Session Timeout for Risk Mitigation:**

   Sessions for accounts using email and password authentication, including those with two-factor authentication, automatically expire after three days of user inactivity to mitigate risks.

### Network Security

* **Transmission Confidentiality:**

   We use HTTPS with TLS 1.2 & above encryption, to secure transmitted data.

* **Data Protection in Testing:**

   Customer data in non-production environments receives the same security standards as in production.

* **Centralized Security Event Logging:**

   Our infrastructure logs security-related actions across critical systems for auditing purposes.

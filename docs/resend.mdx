    <Steps>
      <Step title="Go to vendors tab from the side navigation panel. Select 'Email' channel" />

      <Step title="Select the relevant notification category from the list">
        <Steps>
          <Step title="System">
            **System** for time-sensitive notifications like OTP, Forgot Password and Verification emails. These notifications can't be unsubscribed by the users and are given the highest priority in notification send queues.
          </Step>

          <Step title="Transactional">
            **Transactional** notifications are sent in response to some user transaction or action on your platform like Payment Confirmation, booking confirmation, Post shared / liked, and reminders. They are second in priority in notification queues after system notifications. [Know more about transactional category here](/docs/notification-category#transactional)
          </Step>

          <Step title="Promotional">
            **Promotional** notifications are sent out to users to increase sales, promote products, or bring users back to your platform like newsletters, announcements, upcoming sale or event, deals and discounts etc. These communications are generally sent in bulk, consuming a significant portion of the communication pipeline. That's why they are given the least priority in notification queue.

## Whitelist email domain on Resend

A domain is used to send emails using your own domain. Verifying a domain is a required step because it’s essential to ensuring the deliverability of your emails. You can verify a domain by setting DKIM DNS record.

Go to Domains tab on Resend dashboard to add your domain. Know more about [domain verification here](https://resend.com/docs/dashboard/domains/introduction).

## Configuring Open/Click tracking for emails on Resend

One of the platform advantage of using SuprSend as a central communication system is that it shows notification analytics for all channels in your SuprSend account at a single place.

Go to the webhook tab from side navigation on your resend account and add SuprSend webhook endpoint and select all events to listen.

## How to add Unsubscription link in email

It is advisable to give your recipients the ability to unsubscribe from emails. First, it is required by the [CAN-Spam Act](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/can-spam-act-compliance-guide-business). Second, if you don’t give them this option, they are more likely to click on the spam complaint button, which will cause more harm than allowing them to unsubscribe. Finally, many ESPs look for unsubscribe links and are more likely to filter your email if they don’t have them.

You can directly add unsubscription link in your email using `$hosted_preference_url` variable in your template. This link directs users to the [SuprSend preference page](/docs/preferences). With SuprSend preference setting, you have the flexibility to create multiple notification categories based on the type of notifications. This allows users to opt-out of specific notification categories, providing them with granular control over their preferences compared to other email services where they can only opt-out from all marketing communications at once.

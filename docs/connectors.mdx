## Connector Types

There are 3 types of connectors in SuprSend:

### Third party data source
Used to sync event and user data from a third-party platform to power notifications or sync user cohorts (lists) in SuprSend.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Mixpanel" href="/docs/mixpanel">
  Export user cohorts from Mixpanel into SuprSend and create subscriber [lists](/docs/lists) to trigger notifications via [broadcast API](/docs/broadcast).
</Card>
<Card title="Segment" href="/docs/segment">
  Sync users and events from Segment to SuprSend to power automated workflows, a low-code way to trigger notifications.
</Card>
</CardGroup>

### Third party data destination
Used to sync data like message templates and notification metrics that we track in SuprSend back to your data warehouse for reporting and analysis.

<Card title="Amazon S3" href="/docs/amazon_s3_v2">
  Export notification logs and metrics in your S3 bucket for internal or in-product reporting and analysis.
</Card>

### Database

Database connector enables you to setup notifications directly on top of the data from your data warehouse. This way data, product and growth teams can directly setup production notifications and automated marketing campaigns on the 360 degree data without doing any trade-offs on the amount of data available in click stream platforms.

Using database connector, you can directly sync user profiles and create lists in SuprSend with a simple SQL query, without any engineering effort. You can then use these lists to send broadcasts.
<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Postgres" href="/docs/postgres">
  Sync user profiles and create lists in SuprSend on top of Postgres database.
</Card>
<Card title="MySQL" href="/docs/mysql">
  Sync user profiles and create lists in SuprSend on top of MySQL database.
</Card>
<Card title="Bigquery" href="/docs/bigquery">
  Sync user profiles and create lists in SuprSend on top of BigQuery database.
</Card>

## Add Connectors based on workspaces

Most of these platforms have different project for staging and for production. Since each workspace in SuprSend has separate connector settings, you can connect your staging connector project to your staging workspace, and your production connector project to your production workspace.

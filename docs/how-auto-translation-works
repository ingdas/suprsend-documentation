---

At SuprSend, we have a team of highly skilled translators who handles the translation tasks in an accurate and timely manner.

### Why Manual translation?

Though machine translators are fast, it still lags in accuracy of translation, which are crucial to delivering the right message to users. Even google translate has an accuracy of \~85% which is known to provide one of the best accuracies.

### How it works?

On the language modal, you'll see an option to enable **"Auto Translate"**. Click on it if you want us to translate content in your preferred language.

Once, you enable **"Auto Translate"**, our team will receive a request that you have opted-in for translation. To ensure that we deliver high quality translations, we would reach out to you to better understand your requirement -

* What languages to translate

* What will be the required SLA

* Who is the customer - it will help to set the tone right for translation etc.

After the discussion is done, we'll setup the translation process. All you have to do is then,

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add the required languages in your template from the language modal.">
    For example, in *Fig 2*, ***Spanish*** and ***French*** are the added languages.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add English content and Publish the version.">

  </Step>

  <Step title="Step 3">
    As soon as the version is published, our team will translate english content in other languages which were not published and publish a new version. For example, ***French*** and ***Russian*** in the above image will be translated by the team from the english content which was published. A new version with French, English and Russian content will then be published.

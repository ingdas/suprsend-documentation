title: "Workspaces"

Workspaces are isolated environments within SuprSend to keep disassociated communications isolated and therefore, manageable. By default, SuprSend provides two Workspaces: **`Staging`** and **`Production`**.

* Each workspace has its own templates, vendor settings, and workflows.

* Workspaces have common organisation settings - they have common brand color guideline.

* Each Workspace has its own **`Workspace Key`** and **`Workspace Secret`**, which you can copy from ***Settings page -> "API keys"*** section

#### Best Practices for creating workspaces:

* Create separate workspaces for each of your testing accounts. SuprSend default are: **`Staging`** & **`Production`**. You can add more workspaces.

* Create separate workspaces if your target users are disjoint sets, and communication strategy is different for them. Eg. you have a marketplace product where your buyers and sellers are different.

* Workspaces should not be separate by products, eg. app, website, mobile web, etc.

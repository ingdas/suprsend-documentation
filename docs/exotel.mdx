### How to get API credentials from your Exotel account

Login to [Exotel account](https://my.exotel.com/) . On the top navigation panel, you'll see "API Credentials" link. Click on it and you'll find all the relevant information required to add in the vendor configuration form.

## Setting callback URL for tracking Exotel DLR response

One of the platform advantage of using SuprSend as a central communication system is that it shows notification analytics for all channels in your SuprSend account together.

In case of Exotel, you don't need to set anything for tracking the DLR reports. Exotel allows the option to pass webhook URL in the message payload itself and so DLR tracking will always be enabled on SuprSend dashboard.

However, for tracking inbound response, you'll have to add inbound webhook in your Exotel dashboard. You can get the webhook URL at the end of the vendor configuration once you have saved your changes.

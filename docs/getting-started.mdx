SuprSend is a notification stack as a service platform for easily creating, managing and delivering notifications to your end users. SuprSend has all the features set which enable you to send notifications in a reliable and scalable manner, as well as take care of end-user experience, thereby eliminating the need to build any notification service in-house.

## Benefits of using SuprSend as your notification stack are that:

* You do not have to do any vendor integrations for channels in your code. You can easily add/remove/prioritise vendors and channels from your SuprSend account,

* You can design powerful templates for all channels together and manage them from a single place,

* You can leverage powerful features to experiment fast with notifications as well as take care of end user experience without writing a single line of code.

## Introduction to Workflows

Communications are made up of multiple components - trigger, logic, content, variables, target user, channels, vendors, etc. Typical communication solutions have one or more components intertwined with each other. SuprSend solves communications from a different and more powerful approach, which we call **Workflows.**

At SuprSend, all the constituent components are decoupled from each other, making it modular in nature. The components can come from any source. All these components are configured as nodes in Workflows, where the processing happens for delivery and optimisation. This allows Workflows to handle any complexity possible in your communication usecases.

## How do you trigger notifications?

You can trigger notifications in one of the two ways:

1. Send events to SuprSend from your frontend clients (android app, website, etc) via SuprSend Client SDK, and create a Workflow on SuprSend platform to trigger notification on an event.

2. Create workflow and trigger notification from your backend itself using an omni-channel HTTPS API method, or you can use our Backend SDK.

All the other components (like vendors, templates, optimisation, scaling, etc.) are created and managed on SuprSend platform. You can check the 'Core Concepts' section that lists down the components used in the platform, so you can navigate the platform and use all the features with ease.

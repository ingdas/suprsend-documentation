title: "Audit Logs"
description: "Track all actions performed inside your SuprSend account."
---

Audit logs provide a complete record of all actions performed by team members on your SuprSend account. Each entry includes who performed the action, when it happened, and details about what changed.

This is particularly useful for maintaining team accountability, tracking security-sensitive operations, and quickly identifying who made specific changes—especially helpful when someone accidentally deletes a service token or makes an unintended configuration change.

<Note>
  Audit logs are available on the Enterprise plan.

1. Go to **Account Settings** by clicking on the user icon in the top right corner of the dashboard.
2. Select [Audit Logs] (https://app.suprsend.com/en/account-settings/audit-logs) tab.

## Tracked actions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Authentication & Key / Token Management" defaultOpen={false}>
    Monitors all security-related changes including authentication methods, API keys, tokens, and signing keys. These are the highest priority events to track.

    **Authentication** (Account Settings → Authentication)
    
    | Action | Description |
    |--------|-------------|
    | `account.mfa_enabled` | Multi-factor authentication (MFA) was enabled for your account. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second verification step when logging in. |
    | `account.mfa_disabled` | Multi-factor authentication (MFA) was disabled for your account. This removes the additional security layer. |

    **Service Tokens** (Account Settings → Service Tokens)
    
    | Action | Description |
    |--------|-------------|
    | `service_token.generated` | A new service token was created. Service tokens are used for authentication of management API requests or for CLI operations. |
    | `service_token.deleted` | Service token was deleted. This token can no longer be used for authentication. |

    **API Keys** (Developers → API Keys)
    
    | Action | Description |

    | `public_api_key.deleted` | Public API key was deleted. This key can no longer be used for authentication. |

    **Signing Keys** (Developers → API Keys)
    
    | Action | Description |
    |--------|-------------|
    | `signing_api_key.generated` | A new signing API key was generated. Signing keys are used to sign JWT tokens for client SDK requests. |

In this guide, we'll cover all the errors returned by the vendor when SuprSend initiates a send call to the vendor. In case of vendor error, you'll see `Trigger failed` or `Failure by Vendor` status in the third step of the logs. Hover over the failed chip to access the specific error message.

| Status: 400 - ApiError 21211: The 'To' number xxxx is not a valid phone number.               | **Possible causes:** - You attempted to initiate text to the phone number which is invalid or was incorrectly formatted. Twilio accepts phone numbers in [E164 format](https://www.twilio.com/docs/glossary/what-e164): `[+] [country code] [subscriber number including area code]` - You tried to send a message from a Twilio phone number to itself (from and to numbers in the request are same)**Solutions:** - Verify phone number has country code attached to it. Eg. `+14155552671` - Check if the [country code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_country_calling_codes#Alphabetical_listing_by_country_or_region) for the phone number is correct. - Verify that the `From` and `To` numbers in the request are not same.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

You'll not be able to send messages to this number unless user resubscribes to the messages by texting [opt-in keywords](https://support.twilio.com/hc/en-us/articles/223134027-Twilio-support-for-opt-out-keywords-SMS-STOP-filtering-) like `START` **Solutions:** - Try [adding a preference centre](/docs/embedded-preference-centre) in your application for users to explicitly define what notifications they want to receive and on which channel, so that you don't end up losing touch with the user on the entire channel out of notification fatigue. - Try adding **multi-channel communication** so that you can reach out to users on other active channels when they disengage from SMS. You can also request the recipient to resubscribe to your messages by reaching out on other channels. - Before sending messages to a recipient, ensure they have consented to receive messages from you. Please read these guidelines to understand [messaging opt-in requirements and best practices](https://www.twilio.com/blog/ctia-messaging-principles-and-best-practices).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Potential reasons could include trying to reach a landline or, in the case of short codes, an unreachable carrier. **Solution:** Use the [Lookup API](https://www.twilio.com/docs/lookup/v2-api) to determine if the number is indeed a landline.

Eg. `+14155552671` - Check if the [country code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_country_calling_codes#Alphabetical_listing_by_country_or_region) for the phone number is correct. - Confirm that the number you are sending to is not a landline, using the [Lookup API](https://www.twilio.com/docs/lookup/v2-api). - If you are attempting to send SMS to an IoT or M2M number, check whether the number format is different from the standard mobile numbers in that country or locality. Often, these numbers have additional digits or unusual formats which do not pass Twilio's number validation.

This may be done by Twilio for violating Twilio’s [Messaging Policy](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/legal/messaging-policy) or [Acceptable Use Policy](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/legal/aup), or by a wireless carrier for violating carrier rules or regulations. Examples of messaging that would be blocked by Twilio are spam, phishing, and fraud. Twilio’s filtering system is in place to protect mobile subscribers from spam or other forms of malicious or unwanted messages. **Solutions:** - Ensure your messaging use case complies with Twilio's [Messaging Policy](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/legal/messaging-policy) or [Acceptable Use Policy](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/legal/aup) - Review the information in [How Does Message Filtering Work?](https://support.twilio.com/hc/en-us/articles/223181848-How-Does-Carrier-Filtering-Work-) to understand what causes filtering. - See [How do I prevent my Twilio messages from being filtered (blocked)?](https://support.twilio.com/hc/en-us/articles/1260803966670-How-do-I-prevent-my-Twilio-messages-from-being-filtered-blocked-) for specific tips on avoiding message filtering. - If you believe your messages are compliant with Twilio and carrier policies, please collect 3 or more examples of Message SIDs that have the “undelivered” status with error 30007, and then [contact twilio Support team](https://www.twilio.com/login?g=%2Fconsole%2Fsupport%2Ftickets%2Fcreate%3F\&t=bc3ebe256e9d1f70c00f8056ead4789b1bffa201c82f27b4ae76384081399fe1). |

Twilio doesn't guarantee message delivery on roaming phones. - Try sending to other phones who have the same mobile carrier (you can use our [Lookup API](https://www.twilio.com/docs/lookup/v2-api) to determine the carrier if you’re unsure). If messages to other phones go through, the issue is likely device related. Try rebooting the device or contact the mobile carrier for help. - If you are sending SMS from an alphanumeric sender ID, see if using a Twilio phone number works better. We’ve observed that certain networks may block alpha sender IDs. - If the recipient number is another Twilio number, ensure that number has an action configured for its Messaging capabilities. Choose any available option like "Webhook" or "TwiML Bin." - Try sending a shorter message to the phone, with simple content that does not include any special characters to verify whether the failure is related to concatenation or character encoding.If the issue still persists, try reaching out to [Twilio support team](https://support.twilio.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

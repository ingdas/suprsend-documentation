In this guide, we'll cover all the errors returned by the vendor when SuprSend initiates a send call to the vendor. In case of vendor error, you'll see `Trigger failed` or `Failure by Vendor` status in the third step of the logs. Hover over the failed chip to access the specific error message.

## Message Error guide

MessageBird uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate success or failure of API requests.

* HTTP response codes in the 2xx range indicate the request was successfully processed.
* HTTP response codes in the 4xx range indicate that there was a client error - for example: authentication error, not enough balance or wrong/missing parameters. Don't worry, the HTTP response body includes a JSON-formatted response that tells you exactly what went wrong. If you're stuck, feel free to [contact support](https://messagebird.com/en/help), we're happy to help you out
* HTTP response codes in the 5xx range indicate a server error. It's considered safe to retry the same request, preferably with a delay

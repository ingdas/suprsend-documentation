## Prerequisite

[Understanding the data structure of logs](/docs/logging#data-structure-of-logs)

## Error stages

Errors can essentially occur at 4 stages when triggering a notification:

* [API Errors](/docs/error-guides#api-errors): These errors occur at API level

* [Workflow is not processed](/docs/error-guides#workflow-not-processed): SuprSend could not process the workflow due to issues in the workflow or event payload such as the user's`distinct_id`is not found in the SuprSend database or missing template information.

* **Workflow processed, but notification for one or more channels is not triggered by SuprSend**: This type of error occurs from template rendering failures or incorrect/missing channel information in the user profile. Refer[section below](/docs/error-guides#notification-not-triggered-by-suprsend)to debug these errors.

* **Vendor didn't accept the sent request or returned delivery failure error**: In such cases, you'll see`Trigger failed`or`Failure by Vendor`status in the third step of the logs. These errors are passed by the vendor when SuprSend initiates a send call to the vendor. Hover over the 'i' icon to view the error message. For detailed troubleshooting, refer to the individual vendor guides.

## API errors

This can happen for two major reasons:

| **2 API requests have the same idempotency key.** SuprSend supports idempotency to ensure that requests can be retried safely without duplicate processing. If Suprsend receives more than one request with the same idempotency\_key in a 24 hour window, it will only process the first request and skip all other requests. Know more about idempotency key [here](/docs/python-trigger-workflow-from-api#idempotent-requests). | Try passing another idempotency key in your workflow or event payload.                                                                                                                                               |
| **If workflow is triggered via event and there is no active workflow associated with that event.**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Check if there is an active workflow created on SuprSend dashboard with the given event name. If not, [Refer documentation](/docs/sending-workflow-from-suprsend-platform) to create workflow on SuprSend dashboard. |

| **no active/preferred channels found for user with distinct\_id:\<distinct\_id>**                                   | This error would essentially mean that user doesn't have any applicable active channels in their profile. Applicable channel is the subset of `template group channel`, `channels specified in workflow $channels key`. This could happen for 2 major reasons: - User doesn't have that channel set in their profile. If the workflow is triggered via event, user's channel is derived from the existing user profile. [Create user profile via API or one of our SDKs](/docs/users#creating-user-profile-on-suprsend). - All identities for that channel are `inactive` in user profile. Channel can be marked inactive using `unset` or `remove` function via [SDK or API](/docs/users#via-sdk). SuprSend also marks the channel identity inactive for email and whatsapp in case of hard errors from vendor end, such as bounced email addresses, unregistered whatsapp numbers. This is done to safeguard your email domain authority or whatsapp rating if you continue to send notifications to users who have reported or marked your email or messages as spam. Additionally, this helps in whatsapp cost saving, as vendor charges for every processed request. Inactive marking period by SuprSend is 15 days for whatsapp and 90 days for email. |

| **recipient: error evaluating jq-expression \<recipient\_expression>, could not be resolved from event properties** | This error occurs when you have overridden the recipient configuration in your workflow, and the jq-expression added in the recipient field is throwing an error or returning null value. To troubleshoot: 1. Navigate to the workflow details page by clicking on the workflow name in the logs. 2. Check the jq-expression added in the recipient field. 3.

| **\<channel\_slug>: template rendering error error: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '0')** | This error generally occurs when you are using handlebars helpers in your template on a nested object and the variable referenced inside the helper has parent key missing. For instance, if you have `{{default location.city "your place"}}` helper in your template, and the workflow data has `location` key missing, this error will occur. |
| **user has unsubscribed from channels \<channel\_array> for category: \<category\_slug>**               | User has opted\_out from the given channel list for `category_slug`. You can get user preference setting for that particular category using [HTTP API](/reference/get-user-preference-all-categories).                                                                                                                                           |
| **no vendor configured for channel: and category: \<notification\_category> and id-provider:**          | This happens when vendor configuration for the given channel and notification category is missing.

| **SubscriberList Broadcast API: template: broadcast applicable live channels: \[channel\_list], but no respective user channels present** | User profile doesn't have any active channel from the channels available in template group. This could happen for 2 reasons: - User doesn't have that channel set in their profile. If the workflow is triggered via event, user's channel is derived from the existing user profile. [Create user profile via API or one of our SDKs](/docs/users#creating-user-profile-on-suprsend). - All identities for that channel are `inactive` in user profile. Channel can be marked inactive using `unset` or `remove` function via [SDK or API](/docs/users#via-sdk). SuprSend also marks the channel identity inactive for email and whatsapp in case of hard errors from vendor end, such as bounced email addresses, unregistered whatsapp numbers. This is done to safeguard your email domain authority or whatsapp rating if you continue to send notifications to users who have reported or marked your email or messages as spam. Additionally, this helps in whatsapp cost saving, as vendor charges for every processed request. Inactive marking period by SuprSend is 15 days for whatsapp and 90 days for email. |

## Frequently Asked Questions:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I triggered an event but it doesn't appear in dashboard logs?" defaultOpen={false}>
    We currently do not track individual event trigger currently unless it's associated with a workflow. If you don't see an event trigger in logs, check if there are active workflows linked to that event on SuprSend dashboard.&#x20;



    Another reason could be if you are using idempotency key and 2 requests have the same idempotency key. SuprSend supports idempotency to ensure that requests can be retried safely without duplicate processing. If Suprsend receives another request with the same idempotency\_key in a 24 hour span, it will skip processing those requests.&#x20;



    Know more about idempotency key [here](/docs/python-trigger-workflow-from-api#idempotent-requests).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I added channels to the user profile, but they are not reflected in subscriber profile on SuprSend dashboard?" defaultOpen={false}>
    Check the format of value passed in user channels. Channel will not be updated in profile if the format is incorrect. Supported format for each channel:

    * SMS, Whatsapp -

      `+15555555555`

      (country code is mandatory)

    * Email -

      `[email protected]`

    * [Refer here](/docs/python-create-user-profile#1-add-user-channels)

      for other channel formats.

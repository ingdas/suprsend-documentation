<Update label="3 months ago" description="version 1.0">
  ## New workflow node: Update User Profile

  You can now update recipient or actor profiles directly within a workflow. This feature simplifies user profile management by enabling real-time updates as part of the workflow process.



  If your have event-based system, where user profile changes are coming as events from your product or a third-party system, you don't need to convert it into user update APIs in your codebase. Simply send events to SuprSend, and let workflows handle user profile updates seamlessly.

  ![](https://files.readme.io/f7bdefc09935b99e8d955213f0d7eab3c93701796aa6f9a6a8e96567ca8135cd-image.png)

  ### Key use cases

  1. **Event-based user profile updates**: Simply send events to SuprSend when user updates their profile in your product or when you are setting custom profile attributes as a side-effect of related action, for example, in a job board, change user's application status when employer shortlists the profile.

  2. **Update user profile based on a workflow step**: Common use cases include fetching data during the workflow to update the user profile or updating the profile when a user successfully completes a step. For instance, during onboarding, update `%completion` in user profile when they complete a step.
</Update>

<Update label="3 months ago" description="version 1.0">
  ## Update Object subscriptions within workflow

  You can now dynamically update [object subscriptions](https://docs.suprsend.com/docs/subscriptions) directly within a workflow. This enhancement eliminates the need for separate API calls for object update, allowing you to manage everything seamlessly within workflows.



  If you have event-based systems where all asset updates are coming in form of event from your product or third-party systems, you don't have to consume those events internally and write custom APIs to update individual assets (user, list, object) in SuprSend. Simply send events and let the workflow handle object subscriptions and user profile updates, making SuprSend truly a single API integration.

  ![](https://files.readme.io/4b3b8685f7ba6cd7df826940fc680f6120a299e14c6ecb615c1fa30e05f9ae4e-image.png)

  ### Example use case

  When someone subscribes to a topic (like a tournament), add them as a subscriber to the corresponding tournament object. Later, just trigger tournament related events to SuprSend and the object will automatically fan out and send notification to all users subscribed to the topic.
</Update>

<Update label="3 months ago" description="version 1.0">
  ## New workflow node: Add / Remove user in list

  You can now dynamically update list users as part of workflow execution. This is a step toward creating user segments based on events or workflow progression, removing the need to call the List Update API separately.

  ![](https://files.readme.io/4720092f5cccb662c8c9311b1116f30402cd39dfb3cb388151845efc8cd57584-image.png)


  ### Key use cases

  1. **Event-based segmentation**- When an event occurs, trigger notification to the user and simultaneously add them to a list for future updates. For example, when a user registers for an upcoming event or webinar, you can send them confirmation email and add them to a list to later send further updates related to the event.

  2. **Workflow Step-based segmentation** - Another use case is dynamically adding or removing a user from the list when they complete a workflow step. For example, in a knowledge series designed to onboard new users, remove a user from the POC list once they complete onboarding.
</Update>

<Update label="3 months ago" description="version 1.0">
  ## Deletion APIs

  On customer request, added APIs to dynamically delete entities in SuprSend. Following deletion APIs are added:

  * [Delete user profile](/reference/delete-user)

  * [Delete list](/reference/delete-list)

  * [Delete tenant/brand](/reference/delete-tenant)

  * [Delete Object](/reference/delete-object) and [Remove object subscription](/reference/delete-object-subscriptions)

  These actions are also available on the dashboard for manual management.

  ![](https://files.readme.io/b6e2c61e42973d06c79e51a5cef440b61b6ab4c1325fd98cc8903a0ccf7dcdf1-image.png)

  Delete function just deletes the asset and their related data, including preferences. It doesn't have any effect on the historical workflows or broadcasts already executed. While calling the delete function, ensure no active workflows are running for the asset, else the execution will fail.
</Update>

<Update label="3 months ago" description="version 1.0">
  ## User Merge API: Merge duplicate users into one

  Happy to announce [user merge API](/reference/merge-users) to merge duplicate user identities into a single distinct\_id. This is helpful to consolidate user profiles, especially when users interact across different products or transition from anonymous to identified states.

  ### Key usecases

  * **Cross-Product Identity Consolidation**: When users interact across multiple products (e.g., different apps or services within your platform), they may have different identifiers for each product which needs to be merged later.

  * **Anonymous to Identified Transition**: Platforms often track user actions anonymously before sign-up or login. During this period, user actions are typically tracked under an anonymous ID.

    Upon sign-up, merge the anonymous profile into the newly created identifier to preserve historical data and

    Associate it with the identified user profile.
</Update>

<Update label="3 months ago" description="version 1.0">
  ## User Management APIs

  Being developer first, we have made significant updates and enhancements to the User APIs for easier user management in SuprSend. Also, subscriber is renamed to users in all APIs to avoid confusion with object subscription. Here's a list of all the changes:

  * Introduced new APIs to [fetch user profile](/reference/fetch-user-profile), [list users](/reference/list-users) and [delete user](/reference/delete-user).

  * User update API endpoint has been changed from `/event` to `/user/{{distinct_id}}`.

  * There are 2 separate APIs to create(upsert) and edit user profile. Any addition or changes in existing user properties can be done using [user upsert API](/reference/create-update-users). For deletion of property or channel, [user edit API](/reference/edit-user-profile) can be used. This is done to keep user upsert API structure flat and simple, consistent to how you identify user in workflow trigger.

  * Subscriber is renamed to user in all APIs, including user preference APIs.
</Update>

<Update label="4 months ago" description="version 1.0">
  ## Objects: Design scalable group notifications

  We’re excited to introduce a powerful new capability in SuprSend: [Objects](https://docs.suprsend.com/docs/objects). Objects allow you to manage complex user relationship and notify user groups without identifying individual recipients in your trigger. Ideal for building scalable pub/sub and subscription alerting without having to maintain event to subscriber mapping in your database.&#x20;

  You can directly map [object-user subscription](https://docs.suprsend.com/docs/subscriptions) mapping in SuprSend and SuprSend can efficiently fan-out notifications to thousands of users simultaneously.

  ![](https://files.readme.io/76f305efa893498f97544909690354c70b6d547adc925ab11cf49ec5a65aa6a2-image.png)

  ### What You Can Do with Objects:

  * **Send notifications to non-user entities like group emails, Slack channels, or shared inboxes** (e.g., a Notion feed). Ideal for SaaS applications sending account-level alerts (e.g., anomaly notifications) to shared channels. Objects can have it's own channels and preferences to handle this usecase.

  * **Group users by topic or subscription and send them alerts without having to call individual recipients in the trigger**. A good example could be SaaS applications managing notifications for end-users, where recipient relationships are coming from a different system, and notification triggers or notification calls are coming from a different system which doesn't have information of the users subscribed to that trigger.

  * **Maintain hierarchical user relationship with nested object subscription**. For example, sending announcements to all the entire team of customer while sending invoice related alerts to finance team. You can handle this by creating object for finance team and then adding it as subscriber to customer object.

  Objects can be easily tested from platform with all all object related actions available on SuprSend console. You can programatically manage objects from your codebase using [rest API calls](/reference/create-update-objects). Support for SDKs coming soon...

  If there's any usecase in object that you think is missing and needs to be solved, please reach out to our [support](mailto:support@suprsend.com).
</Update>

<Update label="4 months ago" description="version 1.0">
  ## Datetime comparators in workflow conditions

  You can now compare datetime fields in [workflow conditions](https://docs.suprsend.com/docs/branch#key-value-pair). This lets you compare two timestamps where values can be:

  * **Variable** – computed from workflow input data

  * **Static** – a fixed timstamp (e.g. `2024-01-01T00:00:00Z`)

  * **Relative to current timestamp** – E.g. - "`now`" or "`now+30d`" (current timestamp +/- interval). Current timestamp is calculated at node runtime and is timezone aware.

  ![](https://files.readme.io/c07c30409dcfd8bf250ef4ebdb50e723c1a54dfebed1d81472580fac7d7d08e0-image.png)
</Update>

<Update label="4 months ago" description="version 1.0">
  ## Send node execution log - UI revamp

  The UI for multi-channel and smart routing nodes has been revamped to clearly display how the final list of channels is determined. Now, you get clear visibility into how requested channels in the trigger, override channels, and user and tenant preferences are factored together to compute the final channel list.

  ![](https://files.readme.io/2e6fce94b39f2e764292b909b580f08d010a6e3b4616fea2c823aae39606c22a-image.png)
</Update>

<Update label="4 months ago" description="version 1.0">
  ## Audit Logs

  To enhance security and transparency, we’ve introduced Audit Trail to help you monitor and track actions happening on your SuprSend console. You can use this to keep track of unwanted or malicious actions in your account.&#x20;

  This initial release logs critical account actions along with location and actor details (team member performing the action). You can also filter by team member (actor), specific action or timestamp.

  ![](https://files.readme.io/83548373b4b68f410793913d1114c5d54b9da2b62a59125ccac82d4c93c00b47-image.png)

  Audit logs are available for enterprise users and have customizable retention period. You can find it in account settings.[

</Update>

<Update label="4 months ago" description="version 1.0">
  ## Support for customizing header component in Inbox

  Added support for customizing the header component in inbox SDKs.

  * **@suprsend/react-inbox**

  You can now add a custom component to the right side of the header in the inbox popup. This replaces the "Mark all as read" text with any JSX you provide. You can even include custom icons, such as settings or preferences, in your JSX and use them to navigate users to specific pages. For an example, refer [here](/docs/react-customize-inbox#adding-custom-header-component).

  * **@suprsend/web-inbox**

  In `web-inbox`, you can add an extra icon beside the "Mark all as read" button at the top of the inbox popup using `headerIconUrl`. You can also execute custom logic when this icon is clicked using `headerIconClickHandler`. This feature is useful for cases like displaying settings or preferences icons, which, when clicked, take users to the respective settings or preferences pages. For more information, [refer to the documentation.](/docs/embeddable-inbox#customising-inbox)
</Update>

<Update label="4 months ago" description="version 1.0">
  ## Sample Workflow Library

  With the growing number of workflow nodes, we understand that designing the optimal workflow logic can be tricky. That’s why we’ve built out a library of the most-requested, complex workflow samples to make things easier.&#x20;

  Now, when you create a new workflow, you can pick from these pre-built samples right within the platform. We’ll continue adding more samples over time—if you have specific use cases, feel free to share them with us at [product@suprsend.com](mailto:product@suprsend.com), and we’ll add them in the library!

  * Enhanced observability of Tenant APIs by displaying request logs on the logs page. This improvement provides better visibility and monitoring of API interactions.
</Update>

<Update label="6 months ago" description="version 1.0">
  ## Wait Until - Add Condition on Event Property

  We’re excited to announce a powerful update to our Wait Until feature! You can now add multiple events and apply conditions on event properties within the Wait Until branch, allowing for more precise event filtering and targeting of the exact event required in your workflow.

  This is especially useful for scenarios where the same event triggers multiple workflows, and you want to exit or cancel a notification based on user actions.&#x20;

  For example, in a booking reminder workflow, if a user has multiple bookings, you can now match the booking ID of a cancellation event with the original event to ensure correct reminder gets canceled.

  ![](https://files.readme.io/1ba35d4c66847b75289511ca5654cd10795346646a474b59330be2364b5cfd2e-image.png)

  ### Key Changes:

  * Add conditions on event properties using a simple key-operator-value expression (e.g., booking\_id = 123). Add condition on multiple event properties using `AND`,`OR`.

  * Apply conditions across multiple events (e.g., avoid sending a notification if a user completes an action or achieves a specific milestone).

  [Refer documentation](/docs/wait-until#fixed-delay) for details on how to implement wait until node in your workflow.
</Update>

<Update label="6 months ago" description="version 1.0">
  ## Enhanced branching capabilities

  We are excited to announce significant improvements to our [branching capabilities](/docs/branch). With the addition of more data types, you can now set precise conditions on various inputs within your branches, such as actor, recipient, and brand properties. This enhancement allows you to tailor your workflows more effectively, ensuring that each journey is as personalized and efficient as possible.

  If you haven't yet explored our branching feature, now is a great time to do so. It offers a robust way to construct multi-step journeys within a single workflow.

  Here are some example use cases where you could use branch:

  * A/B test notification content by splitting cohorts based on user properties like region.

  * Customize digest schedules (immediate, daily, weekly) using key in your trigger data or recipient’s preference.

  * For support ticket requests, adjust who gets alerts, when to send them (immediately or batched), and which channels to use based on the issue’s priority.

  * Define different next steps in an onboarding checklist depending on a user’s completion percentage. Here, you can also [fetch](/docs/fetch) completion% just before sending the next reminder.

  ## Workflow - Branching on Message Status
  You can now branch workflows based on message status, **enabling routing decisions using actual delivery and engagement signals**. This is especially useful for reminder and escalation workflows—for example, sending a follow-up notification only if the initial message was not seen.
  <Frame caption="Condition satisifies when message status on any channel in multi-channel delivery node is 'seen'">

  ## Hosted Preference Page — Modern Design with Multi-Language Support

  The hosted preference page has been updated with a refreshed UI and locale-aware localization support. Static UI content (CTAs, labels, system text) is translated automatically using built-in i18n support for up to 23 languages. Dynamic content, including notification category names and descriptions, is rendered using the translation files configured by you, based on the user’s locale.

  ## Category Translations for Preference Centers

  Reach users worldwide with **category translations** — show your preference centers in your users' native language. Whether your users speak Spanish, French, German, or any other language, they'll see category names and descriptions in their preferred locale, making it easier for them to understand and manage their notification preferences.

  **What you get:**
  - **Multi-language support**: Upload translations via Dashboard, API, or CLI — choose the method that works best for your workflow
  - **Smart fallbacks**: If a translation isn't available for a specific locale (e.g., `es-AR`), we automatically try the base locale (`es`), then fall back to English — your users always see something meaningful
  - **Zero maintenance**: English translations are automatically generated from your category names and descriptions, so you don't need to manage them separately

  ## 📚 S3 Connector v2.0 — Comprehensive Notification Data Export

  S3 Connector v2.0 exports end-to-end notification data to your S3 bucket, giving you full visibility into requests, workflows, and message delivery for analytics, debugging, and compliance. It replaces the limited v1.0 connector with complete, structured logging.

  <Note>S3 Connector v1.0 will be deprecated over time. Migrate to v2.0 to access full logs and notification analytics.</Note>

  ### What's New
  We've added 3 data points for **end-to-end traceability** of notifications from **API request → workflow execution → final delivery**:
  - **Messages:** Delivery status, engagement metrics, vendor responses, and failures
  - **Workflow Executions:** Step-by-step workflow logs for debugging conditions, preferences, and errors
  - **Requests:** API payloads and responses for trigger-level debugging and audit trails

  ### Use Cases

  - Internal analytics or customer-facing analytics
  - Debug delivery and workflow issues using detailed logs or show logs on your customer portal
  - Maintain audit trails for compliance and internal reporting
  - Query and analyze notification data you fully own
<br/>
  📘 Check out the [S3 Connector v2.0 documentation](/docs/amazon_s3_v2) for more details.

  ## 🚀 SuprSend CLI Beta - Ship Notification changes like code

  We're excited to announce the **[public beta of SuprSend CLI](https://docs.suprsend.com/reference/cli-intro)**, bringing full notification management to your terminal. Using CLI, you can manage and promote assets across workspaces, integrate with CI/CD, and treat notification changes just like code.

  ![SuprSend CLI](/images/cli-cl.png)

  ### What You Can Do

  - **Promote assets across workspaces** — move workflows, schemas, events, and categories between environments (e.g., staging → production) with `suprsend sync` or targeted pull/push commands.
  - **Automate with CI/CD Deployment** – Release notification changes through feature or bugfix branches, just like any other piece of code: version it, test it, and deploy it.
  - **Manage notification changes in Git** — pull assets locally, version them alongside your application code, and push updates as feature branches or bugfix releases.
  - **Treat notification infrastructure just like code** — review, branch, merge, and release with the same version control workflows you already use.

  ### Built for developers

  - **Code reviews for notifications** — keep your notification infrastructure in Git, track changes, and roll back when needed.
  - **Approval gates for production** — ensure no change goes live without review and approval.
  - **Work with assets locally** — create, edit, and test workflows, schemas, and translation files on your machine.
  - **Version control & rollback** — maintain change log and safely revert changes when required.

    ---

    This is a **beta release** — we’re actively gathering feedback and making improvements. So, feel free to report an issue and contribute to the project.\

  ## 🤖 SuprSend MCP Server (Beta) — AI-Powered Notification Management

  Your AI agents, copilots, and LLM tools can now directly interact with SuprSend through natural language, making notification management as simple as having a conversation.

  ![MCP](/images/mcp-cl.png)

  ### What You Can Do with SuprSend MCP

  **Everyday workflows with AI:**

  - **Trigger workflows on demand**\
    _“Run the approval-required workflow for user John Doe to test my setup.”_
  - **Bootstrap test data**\
    _“Create a sample user named John Doe and a tenant called acme-corp in my workspace.”_
  - **Manage preferences**\
    _“Enable email notifications for marketing and disable SMS.”_
  - **Configure branding**\
    _“Update the logo and primary color for the enterprise tenant.”_

  **Vibe-code with AI:**

  - Ask AI to fetch **setup guides, code examples, or integration snippets** directly from SuprSend docs and apply it in your application code.
  - Expose **safe, scoped endpoints** (via MCP) that wrap APIs with context, reducing guesswork and hallucinations.
  - Integrate with **LLM-based assistants** (Claude, Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.) to simplify notification setup with SuprSend.
  ---
  ### Compatible AI Tools

  Works with Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, and any MCP-compatible AI agent.

  ### Notes & Caveats (Beta) -

  - APIs, behavior, or scopes may change based on feedback.
  - We restrict destructive operations (e.g. deletes) initially to reduce risk.
  - We welcome your feedback — report issues and share feedback to help us harden MCP for production.
  ---

  ### Getting Started

  Start the MCP server and configure it with your AI tool. See our [MCP setup guide](/reference/mcp-overview) for detailed instructions.

  ## Send Notifications Only to Verified Channels in Sandbox

  Sandbox workspaces come pre-configured with SuprSend vendors for quick testing. However, we noticed some cases of misuse where test messages were being sent to unintended recipients.

  To prevent accidental spam and keep Sandbox safe, notifications can now only be sent to **verified channels**.  You can set upto 5 verified channels for each channel type. Reach out to us if you need more.

  You can add and manage your verified channels from [developers -> Verified Channels page](https://app.suprsend.com/en/staging/developers/verified-channels).

  ![Verified Channels in Sandbox](/images/verified-channels_CL.png)

</Update>

<Update label="12 September 2025">
  ## Test Mode: Test Notifications safely without sending to real users

  Testing notifications shouldn't mean worrying about accidentally pinging your customers. In most companies, teams end up redirecting notifications to shared inboxes like [qa@company.com](mailto:qa@company.com) or [dev@company.com](mailto:dev@company.com) just to avoid delivery to real users—while still being able to debug the full notification flow.

  ![Test Mode](/images/test-mode_CL.png)

  With [Test Mode](/docs/developer/test-mode), you can now replicate this real-world testing flow directly in our platform:

  - **Test end-to-end notification flow**: Add channels belonging to internal testers as test channels. In test mode, notifications to these channels are delivered normally—so you can preview messages on real devices.
  - **Set Up Test Channels**: You can add channels belonging to your internal testers as test channels. Delivery will not be blocked for test channels in test mode. This helps you see preview of the notification in your real device.
  - **Catch-All Routing**: Redirect all non-test notifications to a common channel (e.g., a QA inbox), making it easy to trace and debug every message in one place.

This ensures you can confidently test notification workflows in an environment that mirrors production—without the risk of real users getting test messages.

</Update>

<Update label="30 August 2025">
  ## Validate workflow trigger Payload using JSON Schema

  We’ve introduced **API-level JSON Schema validation** for workflow trigger payloads. This catches payload mismatches before execution, preventing runtime failures and ensuring consistent, correct notifications.

  ![JSON Schema Validation](/images/schema.png)

  ### Why it matters

  When you trigger a workflow, you pass data (payload) that is used to resolve workflow variables and populate dynamic content in templates. Currently, If the payload does not include all the variables expected in the workflow, the execution may fail at different stages. With this change, Validation will happen at API level and there'll be:

  - **Fewer runtime failures**: Stop workflows from starting with missing or malformed data.
  - **Faster debugging**: Get a clear, structured error list at request time—no more hunting through multi-step logs.
  - **More reliable messaging**: Prevent partial runs, inconsistent behavior, and incorrect or incomplete notifications.

  ---
  ### How it works

  You can add JSON schema from [Schema page](https://app.suprsend.com/en/staging/developers/schema) and then link it to the workflow [Trigger step](https://docs.suprsend.com/docs/validate-workflow-payload#linking-schema-to-workflow) or trigger Event from [events page](https://app.suprsend.com/en/staging/events).

  - When you trigger a workflow, the payload is validated against a JSON Schema that describes the expected data used to resolve variables and populate dynamic content.
  - If the payload doesn’t match the schema, the Trigger API returns error response with a list of validation errors (e.g., path, expected type, missing fields).
  - If validation passes, the workflow proceeds as usual.
  
  ---
  ### Fixes and Improvements:

  Workflow slug validation at the API layer: If a referenced workflow slug isn’t available, the error is now returned directly in the API response (in addition to request logs) for faster debugging.

  <Note> This validation will only apply to new workflows created after this change. If you want to apply it all your existing workflows, reach out to SuprSend support.</Note>

<Update label="19 August 2025">
  ## Message logs revamp

  - **Redesigned UI** for seamless tracking of notification lifecycles. Quickly view delivery status, opens, clicks, and errors across all channels in a single log view.
  - **Entity-level visibility**: Drill down into logs by workflow, user, object, or list to understand exactly what happened in context.
  - **Advanced filtering**: Filter logs by status, workflow, template, channel, category, or time range to debug faster.
  - **Consistent date range filter** across all log pages, making it easier to trace the journey of a notification from request → workflow → final message delivery and it's interaction state.

![Message Logs Revamp](/images/message-logs_CL.png)

  ## Role based auth in AWS SNS

  In line with our ongoing efforts to enhance platform security, we’ve also enabled IAM Role- based auth in AWS SNS vendor. Previously, authentication required creating an **IAM User** and sharing long-term access keys. With **IAM Role-based auth**, you can grant **temporary, scoped access** without exposing sensitive credentials.
</Update>

<Update label="30 Apr 2025">
  ## SuprSend tracked Properties Now Available in Recipients Payload

  Recipient payloads now include key internal properties—like user type and their unique identifier—making them readily accessible for use in templates and workflows.
  → For users: `{“$type”: “user”, “distinct_id”: “xxxx”}`

  → For objects: `{“$type”: “object”, “object_type”: “xxx”, “id”: “xxx”}"`

  Use these properties to pre-fill form values, add conditional branching based on user type, or Create dynamic links using unique user IDs
</Update>

<Update label="23 Apr 2025">
  ## Workflow Conditions - Array Comparison Operators

  Now, find an element in array or find intersections between two arrays in workflow conditions.
  Example Use cases:

  - Send a notification to users whose role is one of `["admin","manager"]`
  - Notify tournament followers who have subscribed to any of the playing teams or players.

  ![Intersects & not-intersects operators](/images/workflow-conditions.png)

</Update>

<Update label="15 Apr 2025">
  ## Introducing Preference Tags

  Filter notification categories shown to users based on tags like role, team, or department—so Finance sees billing alerts, and Engineers see only error and anomaly categories.

  You can assign multiple tags to each preference category or section, and define complex logical expressions (e.g. role == "manager" && department in ["sales", "marketing"]) to dynamically show relevant preference categories per user.

  Great for building clean, personalized preference centers without bloating the UI.

  ![Preference Tag within Categories](/images/pref-tag.png)

</Update>

<Update label="7 Apr 2025">
  ## Documentation Revamp–Cleaner, Smarter, More Interactive

  We’ve overhauled our documentation experience to make it more consistent, intelligent, and user-friendly:

  - **Brand-Aligned UI**: The docs now match the look and feel of the SuprSend platform.
  - **AI-Powered Search**: Get smarter, faster answers with AI-supported search. You can also open documentation directly in **ChatGPT or Claude** for conversational, AI-driven assistance.
  - **Improved Readability**: Upgraded UI components provide a cleaner layout and better readability, helping you navigate and understand complex topics more easily.
  - **Interactive API Reference**: Try out API requests directly from the docs and view live responses in real-time—no need to switch tools.

  This revamp is part of our ongoing effort to make implementation faster, smoother, and more intuitive for developers.

<Update label="27 Mar 2025">
  ## Cross Lookup User Subscriptions

  Easily view all of a user’s subscriptions—whether to **lists or objects**—in one place. The **Subscriptions tab** on the user details page now provides a centralized view for easier access to user subscriptions.


  ![User Subscription](/images/cross-lookup-cl.png)

  ### Fixes in workflows UI

  - Resolved an issue where newly published workflow versions wouldn’t appear without a page refresh (introduced after version history was added).
  - Fixed a bug in the test trigger modal where object suggestions incorrectly appeared when switching from API to event trigger.
  - Removed the success metric from delivery nodes where it's not relevant (except for Smart Delivery Nodes).
</Update>

<Update label="20 Mar 2025">
  ## Workflow Trigger Overrides

  Event-Based triggers now support overriding the actor, recipient, tenant, and object—directly within the workflow. This removes the need to resolve recipients in your code, allowing you to pass internal events as-is and dynamically resolve users and related context per workflow.

  Perfect for use cases like sending a daily digest to tenant admins or notifying internal account managers at a parent company—all from the same event trigger.

<Update label="20 Feb 2025">
  ## In-App: Fetch cross tenant feed

  We’ve recently been hearing multi-tenant use cases where a user belong to multiple tenants and would want to see Inbox feed for all tenants in a single product. e.g., an account manager is handling multiple client accounts and need to see updates or daily reports linked to all their accounts in a single feed.

  You can now achieve this by passing `tenantId = *` while initializing the Inbox.

  ```javascript SuprSendInbox
  interface ISuprSendInbox {
    workspaceKey: string
    distinctId: string | null
    subscriberId: string | null
    tenantId?: "*"
    ...
  }
  ```

  ## Workflow - Step-by-Step Analytics

  You can now track consolidated view of users' workflow journey at each workflow step directly in the workflow graph. Track user entry, exit, drop-offs, branch followed, and node failures. You can also see workflow edit history and compare analytics across different workflow versions and time range.

  ![Workflow Analytics](/images/workflow-node-analytics.png)

  **Next up:** Deeper analysis into each workflow step - notification engagement (deliver, seen, click), failures, and AI-powered insights.

  ## Improvements:

  - Added data centre field in account settings to check where your data centre region.
</Update>

<Update label="12 Feb 2025">
  ## Batch - Flush First Item Immediately

  We've introduced a new setting in batch processing: [Flush First Item in Batch](/docs/batch#flush-first-item-immediately). Previously, batches were only sent once the batch window closed. Now, this setting allows the first trigger to flow past the batch immediately while subsequent triggers are batched within the specified time window.

  This helps you to build leading debounce logic in workflows, where users are notified immediately about critical updates like anomaly alerts, while other alerts are batched and sent at regular intervals until the issue is resolved.

  You can find this option in **batch -\> advanced configuration**.
</Update>

<Update label="07 Feb 2025">
  ## Workflow - Relative Delay and Batch window

  Added the ability to set relative delays and batch windows in workflows. Previously, delays were fixed or dynamic, with the time difference always being based on the current time. With this update, you can now define delays relative to a future timestamp, often provided by your trigger payload.

  For instance, send a reminder 30 minutes after a task's due time or send feedback 5 minutes after an event or webinar.

  ![Relative Delay and Batch window](/images/relative-delay-cl.png)


  ### Fixes and Improvements:

  - In Inbox drop-in popover component, we fixed scroll bar causing empty padding UI issue in macOS when **Show Scroll bars: Always** is enabled.
  - In Inbox drop-in popover component, action menu popup of last notification item was getting cropped. We have fixed this issue.
  - In Inbox drop-in popover component, in mobile view actions menu icon (3 dots icon) only appears on touching notification. After the bug fix, the actions menu icon will appear on all notifications in mobile view by default, removing extra touch interaction.
</Update>

<Update label="31 Jan 2025">
  ## Nested Objects - Choose the fan out depth

  Previously, when triggering workflows in [nested object hierarchies](/docs/object-subscriptions#adding-nested-object-hierarchies) (where one object subscribes to another), notifications would automatically fan out up to two levels—sending notification to object, its direct subscribers, and child object subscribers.

  Now, you have full control over how deep the fan-out should go. You can now set the [depth](/docs/object-subscriptions#object-subscription-fan-out-in-trigger) in the recipient payload, defining how far the workflow should propagate to fetch subscriptions.

  🔹 Depth 0 → Notify only the object’s channels (e.g., Slack team, shared inbox).<br />
  🔹 Depth 1 → Notify the object’s channels + direct subscribers.<br />
  🔹 Depth N → Expand deeper into hierarchical subscriptions as needed.

  ```json
  "recipients": [
    {
      "object_type": "teams",
      "id":"finance",
  
      //optional parameter to define subscription fan-out depth in workflows
      "$object_subscriptions_query": {
        "depth": 0
      }
    }
  ]
  ```

  You can use this to build **Escalation Workflows** or **Tiered Customer Support Notifications**, send notification to a shared slack channel or customer support queue first and then escalate to individual users in case of no response in a given time duration.

  ### Fixes and Improvements:

  - [SDK] [Object methods](/docs/java-objects) and [User APIs](/docs/java-create-user-profile) to fetch user and their subscription exposed in Java SDK
  - Added support to trigger multi-lingual templates in [broadcast](/docs/broadcast)
</Update>

<Update label="29 Jan 2025">
  ## New handlebars helpers - jsonParse and jsonPath

  We’ve added handlebars helpers to seamlessly handle JSON strings in the template editor:

  - `jsonParse` - Converts a JSON string into an object, making it easier to apply conditions or use JSON strings in merge tags.
  - `jsonPath` - Fetch data corresponding to a path within a JSON object. Works well with jsonParse to directly access nested data in JSON string without block helpers.

  ### Fixes and Improvements:

  - Opened up merge tag input to support handlebars helper in [email merge tags](/docs/email-template#adding-array-elements%3A).
  - Added support for handlebars helper in [display condition](/docs/email-template#display-email-blocks-based-on-condition).
</Update>

<Update label="27 Jan 2025">
  ## List entry/exit events in trigger

  You can now trigger a workflow when a user enters or leaves a list. Use this in the Wait Until node to stop reminders or dynamically route users in a workflow on list updates. Earlier, you could achieve the same by enabling event tracking on list updates. Now, you can simply add this logic in workflow without making any changes in list.

  This will help you build workflows on user lists like, send series of activation notifications to users who didn't interact with the product in last 30 days and stop sending when they become active again.

  ![List entry/exit events in trigger](/images/list-entry-trigger-cl.png)

  ## Athena database connector

  We’ve added Athena to our list of database connectors, enabling you to sync and create dynamic user lists directly from your S3 database. Since Athena can be set up on top of S3, it’s an excellent way to consolidate data from multiple sources and run queries on the unified dataset without the need for complex ETL pipelines.

  ## New workflow node: Invoke Workflow

  With this update, you can [invoke a workflow](/docs/invoke-workflow) from within another workflow. This is useful when the recipient list or data context changes between steps in a workflow.

  **A common use case is escalation workflows**—e.g., if a team member doesn't take action within a set time frame, the workflow escalates the issue and notifies their manager.

  ![Invoke Workflow](/images/invoke-workflow-cl.png)

  This simplifies complex workflows and supports smooth transitions between related processes, enabling more efficient automation management.
</Update>

<Update label="25 Nov 2024">
  ## New workflow node: Update User Profile

  You can now update recipient or actor profiles directly within a workflow. This feature simplifies user profile management by enabling real-time updates as part of the workflow process.

  If your have event-based system, where user profile changes are coming as events from your product or a third-party system, you don't need to convert it into user update APIs in your codebase. Simply send events to SuprSend, and let workflows handle user profile updates seamlessly.

  ![Update User Profile](/images/update-user-profile-cl.png)

  ### Key use cases

  1. **Event-based user profile updates**: Simply send events to SuprSend when user updates their profile in your product or when you are setting custom profile attributes as a side-effect of related action, e.g., in a job board, change user's application status when employer shortlists the profile.
  2. **Update user profile based on a workflow step**: Common use cases include fetching data during the workflow to update the user profile or updating the profile when a user successfully completes a step. For instance, while the onboarding process, update `%completion` in user profile when they complete a step.
</Update>

<Update label="20 Nov 2024">
  ## Update Object subscriptions within workflow

  You can now dynamically update [object subscriptions](https://docs.suprsend.com/docs/subscriptions) directly within a workflow. This enhancement eliminates the need for separate API calls for object update, allowing you to manage everything seamlessly within workflows.

  If you have event-based systems where all asset updates are coming in form of event from your product or third-party systems, you don't have to consume those events internally and write custom APIs to update individual assets (user, list, object) in SuprSend. Simply send events and let the workflow handle object subscriptions and user profile updates, making SuprSend truly a single API integration.

  ![Update Object subscriptions within workflow](/images/update-obj-cl.png)

  ### Example use case

  When someone subscribes to a topic (like a tournament), add them as a subscriber to the corresponding tournament object. Later, just trigger tournament related events to SuprSend and the object will automatically fan out and send notification to all users subscribed to the topic.
</Update>

<Update label="17 Nov 2024">
  ## New workflow node: Add / Remove user in list

  You can now dynamically update list users as part of workflow execution. This is a step toward creating user segments based on events or workflow progression, removing the need to call the List Update API separately.

  ![Add / Remove user in list](/images/add-user-in-list-cl.png)

  ### Key use cases

  1. **Event-based segmentation**: When an event occurs, trigger notification to the user and simultaneously add them to a list for future updates. e.g., when a user registers for an upcoming event or webinar, you can send them confirmation email and add them to a list to later send further updates related to the event.
  2. **Workflow Step-based segmentation**: Another use case is dynamically adding or removing a user from the list when they complete a workflow step. e.g., in a knowledge series designed to onboard new users, remove a user from the POC list once they complete onboarding steps.
</Update>

<Update label="15 Nov 2024">
  ## Deletion APIs

  On customer request, added APIs to dynamically delete entities in SuprSend. Following deletion APIs are added:

  - [Delete user profile](/reference/delete-user)
  - [Delete list](/reference/delete-list)
  - [Delete tenant/brand](/reference/delete-tenant)
  - [Delete Object](/reference/delete-object) and [Remove object subscription](/reference/delete-object-subscription)

  These actions are also available on the dashboard for manual management.

  ![Deletion APIs](/images/deletion-apis-cl.png)

  Delete function just deletes the asset and their related data, including preferences. It doesn't have any effect on the historical workflows or broadcasts already executed. While calling the delete function, ensure no active workflows are running for the asset, else the execution will fail.
</Update>

<Update label="14 Nov 2024">
  ## User Merge API: Merge duplicate users into one

  Happy to announce [user merge API](/reference/merge-users) to merge duplicate user identities into a single `distinct_id`. This is helpful to consolidate user profiles, especially when users interact across different products or transition from anonymous to identified states.

  ### Key Use Cases

  - **Cross-Product Identity Consolidation**: When users interact across multiple products (e.g., different apps or services within your platform), they may have different identifiers for each product which needs to be merged later.
  - **Anonymous to Identified Transition**: Platforms often track user actions anonymously before sign-up or login. During this period, user actions are typically tracked under an anonymous ID.

    Upon sign-up, merge the anonymous profile into the newly created identifier to preserve historical data and

    Associate it with the identified user profile.
</Update>

<Update label="11 Nov 2024">
  ## User Management APIs

  Being developer first, we have made significant updates and enhancements to the User APIs for easier user management in SuprSend. Also, subscriber is renamed to users in all APIs to avoid confusion with object subscription. Here's a list of all the changes:

  - Introduced new APIs to [fetch user profile](/reference/get-user-profile), [list users](/reference/list-users) and [delete user](/reference/delete-user).
  - User update API endpoint has been changed from `/event` to `/user/{{distinct_id}}`.
  - There are 2 separate APIs to create(upsert) and edit user profile. Any addition or changes in existing user properties can be done using [user upsert API](/reference/create-update-users). For deletion of property or channel, [user edit API](/reference/edit-user-profile) can be used. This is done to keep user upsert API structure flat and simple, consistent to how you identify user in workflow trigger.
  - Subscriber is renamed to user in all APIs, including user preference APIs.
</Update>

<Update label="7 Nov 2024">
  ## Objects: Design scalable group notifications

  We’re excited to introduce a powerful new capability in SuprSend: [Objects](https://docs.suprsend.com/docs/objects). Objects allow you to manage complex user relationship and notify user groups without identifying individual recipients in your trigger. Ideal for building scalable pub/sub and subscription alerting without having to maintain event to subscriber mapping in your database.

  You can directly map [object-user subscription](https://docs.suprsend.com/docs/subscriptions) mapping in SuprSend and SuprSend can efficiently fan-out notifications to thousands of users simultaneously.

  ![Scalable Group Notification](/images/scalable-grp-notif-cl.png)

  ### What You Can Do with Objects:

  - **Send notifications to non-user entities like group emails, Slack channels, or shared inboxes** (e.g. a Notion feed). Ideal for SaaS applications sending account-level alerts (e.g. anomaly notifications) to shared channels. Objects can have it's own channels and preferences to handle this use case.
  - **Group users by topic or subscription and send them alerts without having to call individual recipients in the trigger**. A good example could be SaaS applications managing notifications for end-users, where recipient relationships are coming from a different system, and notification triggers or notification calls are coming from a different system which doesn't have information of the users subscribed to that trigger.
  - **Maintain hierarchical user relationship with nested object subscription**. e.g., sending announcements to all the entire team of customer while sending invoice related alerts to finance team. You can handle this by creating object for finance team and then adding it as subscriber to customer object.

  Objects can be easily tested from platform with all object related actions available on SuprSend console. You can programmatically manage objects from your codebase using [rest API calls](/reference/create-update-objects). Support for SDKs coming soon...

  If there's any use case in object that you think is missing and needs to be solved, please reach out to our [support](mailto:support@suprsend.com).

  ## Datetime comparators in workflow conditions

  You can now compare datetime fields in [workflow conditions](https://docs.suprsend.com/docs/branch#key-value-pair). This lets you compare two timestamps where values can be:

  - **Variable**: computed from workflow input data
  - **Static**: a fixed timestamp (e.g. `2024-01-01T00:00:00Z`)
  - **Relative to current timestamp**: e.g. "`now`" or "`now+30d`" (current timestamp +/- interval). Current timestamp is calculated at node runtime and is timezone aware.

  ## Support for customizing header component in Inbox

  Added support for customizing the header component in inbox SDKs.

  - **@suprsend/react-inbox**

  You can now add a custom component to the right side of the header in the inbox popup. This replaces the "Mark all as read" text with any JSX you provide. You can even include custom icons, such as settings or preferences, in your JSX and use them to navigate users to specific pages. For an example, refer [here](https://github.com/suprsend/suprsend-react-inbox/blob/main/docs/customization.md#customizing-header).

  - **@suprsend/web-inbox**

  In `web-inbox`, you can add an extra icon beside the "Mark all as read" button at the top of the inbox popup using `headerIconUrl`. You can also execute custom logic when this icon is clicked using `headerIconClickHandler`. This feature is useful for cases like displaying settings or preferences icons, which, when clicked, take users to the respective settings or preferences pages. For more information, [refer to the documentation.](/docs/web-components-customisations)

  ## Wait Until - Add Condition on Event Property

  We’re excited to announce a powerful update to our Wait Until feature! You can now add multiple events and apply conditions on event properties within the Wait Until branch, allowing for more precise event filtering and targeting of the exact event required in your workflow.

  This is especially useful for scenarios where the same event triggers multiple workflows, and you want to exit or cancel a notification based on user actions.

  For instance, in a booking reminder workflow, if a user has multiple bookings, you can now match the booking ID of a cancellation event with the original event to ensure correct reminder gets canceled.

  ![Wait Until - Add Condition on Event Property](/images/wait-until-cl.png)

  ### Key Changes:

  - Add conditions on event properties using a simple key-operator-value expression (e.g. `booking_id = 123`). Add condition on multiple event properties using `AND`,`OR`.
  - Apply conditions across multiple events (e.g. avoid sending a notification if a user completes an action or achieves a specific milestone).

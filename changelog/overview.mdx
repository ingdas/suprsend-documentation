<Update label="07 Feb 2025">
  ## Workflow - Relative Delay and Batch window

  Added the ability to set relative delays and batch windows in workflows. Previously, delays were fixed or dynamic, with the time difference always being based on the current time. With this update, you can now define delays relative to a future timestamp, often provided by your trigger payload.



  For instance, send a reminder 30 minutes after a task's due time or send feedback 5 minutes after an event or webinar.

  ![](https://files.readme.io/b0dfc99e1f50f9b25f7c06fe82538fed6cad4082f7810715789bd443e8648951-image.png)

  ### Fixes and Improvements:

  * In Inbox drop-in popover component, we fixed scrollbar causing empty padding UI issue in macOS when **Show Scroll bars: Always** is enabled.

  * In Inbox drop-in popover component, action menu popup of last notification item was getting cropped. We have fixed this issue.

  * In Inbox drop-in popover component, in mobile view actions menu icon (3 dots icon) only appears on touching notification. After the bugfix, the actions menu icon will appear on all notifications in mobile view by default, removing extra touch interaction.
</Update>

<Update label="31 Jan 2025">
  ## Nested Objects - Choose the fan out depth

  Previously, when triggering workflows in [nested object hierarchies](/docs/subscriptions#adding-nested-object-hierarchies) (where one object subscribes to another), notifications would automatically fan out up to two levels—sending notification to object, its direct subscribers, and child object subscribers.



  Now, you have full control over how deep the fan-out should go. You can now set the [depth](/docs/subscriptions#object-subscription-fan-out-in-trigger) in the recipient payload, defining how far the workflow should propagate to fetch subscriptions.



  🔹 Depth 0 → Notify only the object’s channels (e.g., Slack team, shared inbox).
  🔹 Depth 1 → Notify the object’s channels + direct subscribers.
  🔹 Depth N → Expand deeper into hierarchical subscriptions as needed.

  ```json
  "recipients": [
    {
      "object_type": "teams",
      "id":"finance",

      //optional parameter to define subscription fan-out depth in workflows
      "$object_subscriptions_query": {
        "depth": 0
      }
    }
  ]
  ```

  You can use this to build **Escalation Workflows** or **Tiered Customer Support Notifications**, send notification to a shared slack channel or customer support queue first and then escalate to individual users in case of no response in a given time duration.

  ### Fixes and Improvements:

  * \[SDK] [Object methods](/docs/objects-java-sdk) and [User APIs](/docs/java-create-user-profile) to fetch user and their subscription exposed in Java SDK

  * Added support to trigger multi-lingual templates in [broadcast](/docs/broadcast)
</Update>

<Update label="12 Feb 2025">
  ## Batch - Flush First Item Immediately


  We've introduced a new setting in batch processing: [Flush First Item in Batch](/docs/batch#flush-first-item-immediately). Previously, batches were only sent once the batch window closed. Now, this setting allows the first trigger to flow past the batch immediately while subsequent triggers are batched within the specified time window.



  This will help you to build leading debounce logic in workflow, where users are notified about critical updates like anomaly alerts immediately, while batching rest of the alerts and sending them at regular intervals until the issue is resolved.

  You can find this option in **batch -> advanced configuration**.
</Update>

<Update label="29 Jan 2025">
  ## New handlebars helpers - jsonParse and jsonPath

  We’ve added handlebars helpers to seamlessly handle JSON strings in the template editor:

  * `jsonParse` - Converts a JSON string into an object, making it easier to apply conditions or use JSON strings in merge tags.

  * `jsonPath` - Fetch data corresponding to a path within a JSON object. Works well with jsonParse to directly access nested data in JSON string without block helpers.

  ### Fixes and Improvements:

  * Opened up merge tag input to support handlebars helper in [email merge tags](/docs/email#adding-array-elements).

  * Added support for handlebars helper in [display condition](/docs/email#display-blocks-based-on-condition).
</Update>

<Update label="27 Jan 2025">
  ## List entry/exit events in trigger

  You can now trigger a workflow when a user enters or leaves a list. Use this in the Wait Until node to stop reminders or dynamically route users in a workflow on list updates. Earlier, you could achieve the same by enabling event tracking on list updates. Now, you can simply add this logic in workflow without making any changes in list.



  This will help you build workflows on user lists like, send series of activation notifications to users who didn't interact with the product in last 30 days and stop sending when they become active again.

  ![](https://files.readme.io/0d2ac80da908795aaa5ab40e9e0db6d69d6c140e19ebfcb21a8edb5e98a7724d-image.png)

  ### Fixes and Improvements:

  * \[SDK] We have exposed [object management methods](/docs/objects-node-sdk) in Node SDK
</Update>

<Update label="20 Jan 2025">
  ## Inbox 2.0 - better authentication, Inapp feed component and seen interaction

  Happy to announce a major update in our Inbox SDK. Now, you can directly export and embed Inapp feed component and seamlessly create Fullscreen or Side sheet Inbox experience.

  ### What’s New?

  ✅ **Enhanced Security** – We've replaced HMAC authentication with stateless JWT authentication for better security.

  ✅ **Drop-in components** – You can now quickly build an inbox, including fullscreen and side sheet feeds, by directly importing UI inbox components that are available in our SDK.

  ✅ **Bring your own toast** – If you plan to use toast notifications, you have full flexibility to choose any toast library you prefer, allowing you to fully customize the notification experience.



  These updates offer greater flexibility, security, and customization — giving you full control over your in-app notification experience.



  If you are on the older SDK version, we recommend you to move on the new version as all future developments will be done on the new SDK.
</Update>

<Update label="15 Jan 2025">
  ## Interaction Observer: Seen Tracking in Inbox

  We’re excited to introduce Interaction Observer support in the Inbox, enabling smarter tracking of notification seen state. Now, notifications will be automatically marked as "seen" when they come in user's scroll view.
</Update>

<Update label="10 Jan 2025">
  ## Enhanced Broadcast Observability

  We’ve done a major revamp to our [Broadcast logging](https://app.suprsend.com/en/production/logs/broadcast) and monitoring, designed to give you greater control and transparency over your broadcast executions.

  ![](https://files.readme.io/4a9b2a736f887934d3cc2b657cefddd4ccaaa6efc264c2071401fb962322eeda-Broadcast_Executions_1.png)

  Here’s what’s new:

  * **Real-time Execution Tracking**: Monitor broadcast operations as they happen, ensuring you stay informed every step of the way.

  * **Step-by-Step Debugging**: View detailed execution logs for each step of your broadcast, helping you pinpoint errors and resolve issues faster.

  * **Advanced Filters**: Quickly locate specific broadcasts with filters for tenant, list ID, broadcast slug, idempotency key, and status. Easily identify and analyze failure logs.

  * **Detailed Broadcast Summaries**: Access a comprehensive summary of each broadcast run directly from the listing page, similar to workflow execution logs.
</Update>

<Update label="5 Jan 2025">
  ## Athena database connector

  We’ve added Athena to our list of database connectors, enabling you to sync and create dynamic user lists directly from your S3 database. Since Athena can be set up on top of S3, it’s an excellent way to consolidate data from multiple sources and run queries on the unified dataset without the need for complex ETL pipelines.

  ![](https://files.readme.io/327ab9a18551d786e30ac4fbb7bf5e2ec9389e50c779aca5696702b1b9cd8a33-image.png)
</Update>

<Update label="27 Nov 2024">
  ## New workflow node: Invoke Workflow

  With this update, you can [invoke a workflow](/docs/invoke-workflow) from within another workflow. This is useful when the recipient list or data context changes between steps in a workflow.



  **A common use case is escalation workflows**—for example, if a team member doesn't take action within a set timeframe, the workflow escalates the issue and notifies their manager.

  ![](https://files.readme.io/1af5aac87cb2a2a032a22e212e9f21584b093fccda7b81f0df985d1657e87b5d-image.png)

  This simplifies complex workflows and supports smooth transitions between related processes, enabling more efficient automation management.
</Update>

<Update label="25 Nov 2024">
  ## New workflow node: Update User Profile

  You can now update recipient or actor profiles directly within a workflow. This feature simplifies user profile management by enabling real-time updates as part of the workflow process.

  If your have event-based system, where user profile changes are coming as events from your product or a third-party system, you don't need to convert it into user update APIs in your codebase. Simply send events to SuprSend, and let workflows handle user profile updates seamlessly.

  ![](https://files.readme.io/f7bdefc09935b99e8d955213f0d7eab3c93701796aa6f9a6a8e96567ca8135cd-image.png)

  ### Key use cases

  1. **Event-based user profile updates**: Simply send events to SuprSend when user updates their profile in your product or when you are setting custom profile attributes as a side-effect of related action, for example, in a job board, change user's application status when employer shortlists the profile.

  2. **Update user profile based on a workflow step**: Common use cases include fetching data during the workflow to update the user profile or updating the profile when a user successfully completes a step. For instance, during onboarding, update `%completion` in user profile when they complete a step.
</Update>

<Update label="20 Nov 2024">
  ## Update Object subscriptions within workflow

  You can now dynamically update [object subscriptions](https://docs.suprsend.com/docs/subscriptions) directly within a workflow. This enhancement eliminates the need for separate API calls for object update, allowing you to manage everything seamlessly within workflows.

  If you have event-based systems where all asset updates are coming in form of event from your product or third-party systems, you don't have to consume those events internally and write custom APIs to update individual assets (user, list, object) in SuprSend. Simply send events and let the workflow handle object subscriptions and user profile updates, making SuprSend truly a single API integration.

  ![](https://files.readme.io/4b3b8685f7ba6cd7df826940fc680f6120a299e14c6ecb615c1fa30e05f9ae4e-image.png)

  ### Example use case

  When someone subscribes to a topic (like a tournament), add them as a subscriber to the corresponding tournament object. Later, just trigger tournament related events to SuprSend and the object will automatically fan out and send notification to all users subscribed to the topic.
</Update>

<Update label="17 Nov 2024">
  ## New workflow node: Add / Remove user in list

  You can now dynamically update list users as part of workflow execution. This is a step toward creating user segments based on events or workflow progression, removing the need to call the List Update API separately.

  ![](https://files.readme.io/4720092f5cccb662c8c9311b1116f30402cd39dfb3cb388151845efc8cd57584-image.png)

  ### Key use cases

  1. **Event-based segmentation**- When an event occurs, trigger notification to the user and simultaneously add them to a list for future updates. For example, when a user registers for an upcoming event or webinar, you can send them confirmation email and add them to a list to later send further updates related to the event.

  2. **Workflow Step-based segmentation** - Another use case is dynamically adding or removing a user from the list when they complete a workflow step. For example, in a knowledge series designed to onboard new users, remove a user from the POC list once they complete onboarding.
</Update>

<Update label="15 Nov 2024">
  ## Deletion APIs

  On customer request, added APIs to dynamically delete entities in SuprSend. Following deletion APIs are added:

  * [Delete user profile](/reference/delete-user)

  * [Delete list](/reference/delete-list)

  * [Delete tenant/brand](/reference/delete-tenant)

  * [Delete Object](/reference/delete-object) and [Remove object subscription](/reference/delete-object-subscriptions)

  These actions are also available on the dashboard for manual management.

  ![](https://files.readme.io/b6e2c61e42973d06c79e51a5cef440b61b6ab4c1325fd98cc8903a0ccf7dcdf1-image.png)

  Delete function just deletes the asset and their related data, including preferences. It doesn't have any effect on the historical workflows or broadcasts already executed. While calling the delete function, ensure no active workflows are running for the asset, else the execution will fail.
</Update>

<Update label="14 Nov 2024">
  ## User Merge API: Merge duplicate users into one

  Happy to announce [user merge API](/reference/merge-users) to merge duplicate user identities into a single distinct\_id. This is helpful to consolidate user profiles, especially when users interact across different products or transition from anonymous to identified states.

  ### Key usecases

  * **Cross-Product Identity Consolidation**: When users interact across multiple products (e.g., different apps or services within your platform), they may have different identifiers for each product which needs to be merged later.

  * **Anonymous to Identified Transition**: Platforms often track user actions anonymously before sign-up or login. During this period, user actions are typically tracked under an anonymous ID.

    Upon sign-up, merge the anonymous profile into the newly created identifier to preserve historical data and

    Associate it with the identified user profile.
</Update>

<Update label="11 Nov 2024">
  ## User Management APIs

  Being developer first, we have made significant updates and enhancements to the User APIs for easier user management in SuprSend. Also, subscriber is renamed to users in all APIs to avoid confusion with object subscription. Here's a list of all the changes:

  * Introduced new APIs to [fetch user profile](/reference/fetch-user-profile), [list users](/reference/list-users) and [delete user](/reference/delete-user).

  * User update API endpoint has been changed from `/event` to `/user/{{distinct_id}}`.

  * There are 2 separate APIs to create(upsert) and edit user profile. Any addition or changes in existing user properties can be done using [user upsert API](/reference/create-update-users). For deletion of property or channel, [user edit API](/reference/edit-user-profile) can be used. This is done to keep user upsert API structure flat and simple, consistent to how you identify user in workflow trigger.

  * Subscriber is renamed to user in all APIs, including user preference APIs.
</Update>

<Update label="7 Nov 2024">
  ## Objects: Design scalable group notifications

  We’re excited to introduce a powerful new capability in SuprSend: [Objects](https://docs.suprsend.com/docs/objects). Objects allow you to manage complex user relationship and notify user groups without identifying individual recipients in your trigger. Ideal for building scalable pub/sub and subscription alerting without having to maintain event to subscriber mapping in your database.&#x20;

  You can directly map [object-user subscription](https://docs.suprsend.com/docs/subscriptions) mapping in SuprSend and SuprSend can efficiently fan-out notifications to thousands of users simultaneously.

  ![](https://files.readme.io/76f305efa893498f97544909690354c70b6d547adc925ab11cf49ec5a65aa6a2-image.png)

  ### What You Can Do with Objects:

  * **Send notifications to non-user entities like group emails, Slack channels, or shared inboxes** (e.g., a Notion feed). Ideal for SaaS applications sending account-level alerts (e.g., anomaly notifications) to shared channels. Objects can have it's own channels and preferences to handle this usecase.

  * **Group users by topic or subscription and send them alerts without having to call individual recipients in the trigger**. A good example could be SaaS applications managing notifications for end-users, where recipient relationships are coming from a different system, and notification triggers or notification calls are coming from a different system which doesn't have information of the users subscribed to that trigger.

  * **Maintain hierarchical user relationship with nested object subscription**. For example, sending announcements to all the entire team of customer while sending invoice related alerts to finance team. You can handle this by creating object for finance team and then adding it as subscriber to customer object.

  Objects can be easily tested from platform with all all object related actions available on SuprSend console. You can programatically manage objects from your codebase using [rest API calls](/reference/create-update-objects). Support for SDKs coming soon...

  If there's any usecase in object that you think is missing and needs to be solved, please reach out to our [support](mailto:support@suprsend.com).
</Update>

<Update label="3 Nov 2024">
  ## Datetime comparators in workflow conditions

  You can now compare datetime fields in [workflow conditions](https://docs.suprsend.com/docs/branch#key-value-pair). This lets you compare two timestamps where values can be:

  * **Variable** – computed from workflow input data

  * **Static** – a fixed timstamp (e.g. `2024-01-01T00:00:00Z`)

  * **Relative to current timestamp** – E.g. - "`now`" or "`now+30d`" (current timestamp +/- interval). Current timestamp is calculated at node runtime and is timezone aware.

  ![](https://files.readme.io/c07c30409dcfd8bf250ef4ebdb50e723c1a54dfebed1d81472580fac7d7d08e0-image.png)
</Update>

<Update label="30 Oct 2024">
  ## Send node execution log - UI revamp

  The UI for multi-channel and smart routing nodes has been revamped to clearly display how the final list of channels is determined. Now, you get clear visibility into how requested channels in the trigger, override channels, and user and tenant preferences are factored together to compute the final channel list.

  ![](https://files.readme.io/2e6fce94b39f2e764292b909b580f08d010a6e3b4616fea2c823aae39606c22a-image.png)
</Update>

<Update label="29 Oct 2024">
  ## Audit Logs

  To enhance security and transparency, we’ve introduced Audit Trail to help you monitor and track actions happening on your SuprSend console. You can use this to keep track of unwanted or malicious actions in your account.&#x20;

  This initial release logs critical account actions along with location and actor details (team member performing the action). You can also filter by team member (actor), specific action or timestamp.

  ![](https://files.readme.io/83548373b4b68f410793913d1114c5d54b9da2b62a59125ccac82d4c93c00b47-image.png)

  Audit logs are available for enterprise users and have customizable retention period. You can find it in account settings.[

</Update>

<Update label="22 Oct 2024">
  ## Support for customizing header component in Inbox

  Added support for customizing the header component in inbox SDKs.

  * **@suprsend/react-inbox**

  You can now add a custom component to the right side of the header in the inbox popup. This replaces the "Mark all as read" text with any JSX you provide. You can even include custom icons, such as settings or preferences, in your JSX and use them to navigate users to specific pages. For an example, refer [here](/docs/react-customize-inbox#adding-custom-header-component).

  * **@suprsend/web-inbox**

  In `web-inbox`, you can add an extra icon beside the "Mark all as read" button at the top of the inbox popup using `headerIconUrl`. You can also execute custom logic when this icon is clicked using `headerIconClickHandler`. This feature is useful for cases like displaying settings or preferences icons, which, when clicked, take users to the respective settings or preferences pages. For more information, [refer to the documentation.](/docs/embeddable-inbox#customising-inbox)
</Update>

<Update label="16 Oct 2024">
  ## Sample Workflow Library

  With the growing number of workflow nodes, we understand that designing the optimal workflow logic can be tricky. That’s why we’ve built out a library of the most-requested, complex workflow samples to make things easier.&#x20;

  Now, when you create a new workflow, you can pick from these pre-built samples right within the platform. We’ll continue adding more samples over time—if you have specific use cases, feel free to share them with us at [product@suprsend.com](mailto:product@suprsend.com), and we’ll add them in the library!

  ## Better delivery tracking in iOS

  We are excited to announce significant improvements in our latest update, focusing on enhancing delivery tracking for iOS push notifications. Regardless of the application's state, you will now experience more reliable and precise delivery tracking.

  We have rolled out updates for all our major SDKs. To take full advantage of these improvements, please ensure that you update your dependencies promptly.

  * [iOS SDK](https://github.com/suprsend/SuprSend-iOS-SDK/releases/tag/1.0.3) - v1.0.3

  * [React Native SDK](https://github.com/suprsend/suprsend-rn-sdk/releases/tag/v2.4.0) - v2.4.0

<Update label="27 Aug 2024">
  ## Wait Until - Add Condition on Event Property

  We’re excited to announce a powerful update to our Wait Until feature! You can now add multiple events and apply conditions on event properties within the Wait Until branch, allowing for more precise event filtering and targeting of the exact event required in your workflow.

  This is especially useful for scenarios where the same event triggers multiple workflows, and you want to exit or cancel a notification based on user actions.&#x20;

  For example, in a booking reminder workflow, if a user has multiple bookings, you can now match the booking ID of a cancellation event with the original event to ensure correct reminder gets canceled.

  ![](https://files.readme.io/1ba35d4c66847b75289511ca5654cd10795346646a474b59330be2364b5cfd2e-image.png)

  ### Key Changes:

  * Add conditions on event properties using a simple key-operator-value expression (e.g., booking\_id = 123). Add condition on multiple event properties using `AND`,`OR`.

  * Apply conditions across multiple events (e.g., avoid sending a notification if a user completes an action or achieves a specific milestone).

  ## Enhanced branching capabilities

  We are excited to announce significant improvements to our [branching capabilities](/docs/branch). With the addition of more data types, you can now set precise conditions on various inputs within your branches, such as actor, recipient, and tenant properties. This enhancement allows you to tailor your workflows more effectively, ensuring that each journey is as personalized and efficient as possible.

  If you haven't yet explored our branching feature, now is a great time to do so. It offers a robust way to construct multi-step journeys within a single workflow.

  Here are some example use cases where you could use branch:

  * A/B test notification content by splitting cohorts based on user properties like region.

  * Customize digest schedules (immediate, daily, weekly) using key in your trigger data or recipient’s preference.

  * For support ticket requests, adjust who gets alerts, when to send them (immediately or batched), and which channels to use based on the issue’s priority.

  * Define different next steps in an onboarding checklist depending on a user’s completion percentage. Here, you can also [fetch](/docs/fetch) completion% just before sending the next reminder.

  ## Bulk Preference APIs

  We’ve introduced new APIs designed to simplify the migration and management of user preferences within SuprSend.

  * [Get User Full Preference](/reference/get-user-full-preference): Fetch complete user preferences across all categories and channels in a single API call.

  * [Bulk Update User Preference](/reference/bulk-update-user-preference): Update preferences for multiple users across all categories and channels in one go. This API is ideal for batch processing and bulk updates, making large-scale migrations easier.

  * [Reset User Preference](/reference/reset-user-preferences): If you have updated a user's preference by mistake, this API allows you to quickly revert a user's preferences to the default tenant settings.

  Along with these changes, we have also introduced a flag in GET category preference APIs `show_opt_out_channels`. Set this to `true` to see channel list in opt-out preference categories.
